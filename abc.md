# Collaborate With The Clubs for Workshops: Fulfilled
The motive was to familiarise the freshers with the working of various clubs on campus and to ensure that the induction process was done smoothly. During the Fervour week, numerous workshops and events were conducted by the clubs, the schedule of which was extensively planned by the candidate.

# Automatic Vending Machines for Sanitary Napkins: Fulfilled
This point is common to the manifestos of both, the cultural secretary (girls) and the President. The contacts necessary were claimed to have been procured by the President and upon mutual agreement, the matter was taken forward by the President while the candidate was asked to look after the Orientation programme. A sanitary napkin dispenser has been installed in the washroom in the library.

# Cultural/Sanskriti Magazine: In Progress
To celebrate the cultural diversity on campus and to bring out more participation from the regional associations, the candidate has set up a team which has been set into working and bringing out a magazine which has faculty giving a few inputs. The magazine aims to document all the cultural events. This magazine is independent of Journal Club, and the Cultural Secretary claims she has assembled a separate team for it. While her partner also speaks of a Cultural Magazine, there has been no talks on collaboration at the moment. It can be assumed that these are independent of each other.
# Creating a Culture of Martial Arts for Females: In progress
As of now, there is a martial arts class being conducted in the SAC which is an initiative taken up by the NSS, the candidate has claimed to have approach a few individuals with professional training in order to conduct similar classes/workshops for females in the next semester depending on the number of enthusiasts.

# Professionals Offering Classes for Special Skills: In Progress
The candidate intends to have a few classes conducted for skill development, hopefully, conducted by seniors in various clubs who have received professional training, if not, there are plans of roping in a professional from outside the campus for a nominal fee, depending on the number of enthusiasts. The General Secretary has also asked about the interest of the General Body in specific skills recently. It is safe to assume that there is a collaboration here and that work is under progress.
 
# Introduction of  Mini Comic-Con, and conducting Prom Night: In Progress
The candidate plans on having a mini comic con on campus in the next semester but the feasibility of doing so depends entirely on the budget allocation. The prom night was conducted during the Fervour week for the BE freshers, the candidate has, besides scheduling the events, coordinated and roped in Red Bull as a sponsor.

Increasing the scale of informal events and conducting Shangrila: In progress
The candidate intends to conduct various informal nights viz. dramatics, music, dance to name a few. Keeping in mind the commitments and priorities of the relevant clubs, the plan of having events on 3 consecutive nights has been dropped for this semester, but the dramatics and music nights were conducted, the rest of the events are slated to be conducted in the following semester.

Initiation of ethnic food fest : Fulfilled to an extent
The candidate intended to have food trucks which cater food celebrating various cultures during Shangrila or Sanskriti, she claims to have procured contacts and tried her best to bring in the food trucks during Sanskriti, as a result of which there was a dosa and chat stalls amongst the other fast food stalls.

Updating the general body with the cultural and club activities: In progress
The candidate claims that a page has been created on Facebook (Culturals@BPHC) that is not very active as of now due to the lack of awareness amongst the general body. She plans to float a notice regarding the same on BPHC Shoutbox in the beginning of the next semester. It is on this page that the general body will be informed of all the cultural events taking place on this campus.        
        
Sanskriti magazine : Repetition
This is similar to the 3rd  point.
Frequent anaemia screening for girls and setting up of a separate anaemia counter : In Progress
Anaemia screening was done in the first semester by the NSS in association with the Lions’ Club, the candidate mentioned that she is ready to collaborate with the NSS for the same and hopes to conduct a few more screening sessions in the next semester. The result of the first screening showed that the number of anaemic girls was 0, hence no food counter was set-up, if necessary the candidate seem confidant of pushing for a separate counter specifically for the anaemic people.
Organising women-specific events like hack-a-thons, marathons, etc: Not fulfilled 
So far, no event has been organised, the candidate cites the lack of participation and a packed schedule as a reason. She is ready to conduct such events in the next semester if there is enough participation.
Screening of movies in the common room: Not fulfilled
The chances of this being fulfilled are bleak considering the issue of piracy which could arise and no feasible alternative being presented by the candidate.
Page or portal to record the participation in various events: Not Fulfilled
This refers to the page on the SWD portal wherein the achievements are recorded, and there can be incentives such as travel reimbursement for the winners( it’s currently 50%), if the budget permits.

Increasing participation in literary events conducted during Renaissance: In Progress 
In order to increase participation, there is a plan of incentivising the events, that is, the additional points can be converted for merchandise.
Production house: Not fulfilled
It is primarily a space being provided for the performing clubs in the fests, this is still unfulfilled due to the lack of space in the SAC, the candidate is confident of being able to set one up if the required space is acquired.

Conducting ME fresher night: Not fulfilled
The ME fresher night wasn’t conducted to certain issues that arose in the same period before the BE freshers’ leading to the postponing of the orientations and other events and the candidate cited that obtaining necessary permissions would have been hard.
She also claims to have spoken to a few ME students who have expressed workload as a reason for their lack of participation in the club-related activities.
Incentivising Pearl:  In Progress
To improve participation in Pearl, there is a plan to award points to all the winners besides the prize money which can be traded off with Pearl merchandise against a fixed price.
    Besides working on her manifesto, the candidate has also taken initiative or supported the          following general issues:
Solar panels 
 Library time extension
