# Sports Organizing Committee (SOC): Fulfilled
A committee consisting of one representative from each sports team has been created to organize intra college fests such as Rixa and Blitzkrieg. As a result of the formation of this committee, the burden of conducting intra college fests has been removed from the team captains who now have more time to focus on their teams. The SOC managed to conduct 7 events this year when compared to 2 events last year in Rixa. They also handled the logistics for the sports contingents who participated in colleges outside.

# Enhancing the Sports Culture on Campus: In Progress

The Sports Secretary pointed out that a skating rink is being made in the present location of the Infinity Pool. A CS:GO Event was conducted. For Kho-Kho the ground is currently being levelled which will soon be started as an informal sport. Considering that the equipment for Archery is expensive, the Secretary hopes to take advantage of the campaign for Archery in South India and said that he has also spoken to the Secunderabad Club regarding this.  
# Infrastructure Development: Fulfilled
This point promised for “a method for providing regular feedback” will be implemented and that “updates to the sports inventory will be made on a regular basis”.

# Welfare and Aid to Sportspersons: Fulfilled
This point in the manifesto promised for travel concessions for teams that went to tournaments outside to represent our college and for free health kits for players during Arena. The Sports Secretary said that this year the teams that went to BOSM were given a travel reimbursement of 70% which was possible because the Southern Railway sponsored them.
