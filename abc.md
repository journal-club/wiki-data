# Help Initialization: In Progress
The idea behind this was to ease the introduction of new sports on campus. We now have a Tennis girls team (although it only consists of two girls), they continue to practice and participate. This point on the manifesto also includes helping those sports which have started out quite recently, like the Ultimate Frisbee team. Steps have been taken to initiate a Futsal team as well.

# Orientation: Fulfilled
A separate day was held in the 3-day campus orientation for the freshers to introduce them to the sports culture on campus. The Secretary also promised to conduct a minimum of two workshops per sport to improve the existing culture and to get build the sports spirit among the freshers.

# Workshops: Fulfilled
All the girls’ sports teams conducted workshops that went on for multiple days. A timetable was devised and was posted on the Free Expression Group for the women on campus to participate. [Link to timetable](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bphcshoutbox/permalink/1993918424004092/)


# Sports in Hostel: In Progress
The courts are being maintained regularly along with the inventory for Throwball, Volleyball and Carrom. Apart from this, the Table Tennis tables have been replaced but the only shortcoming in this segment is the inventory for Table Tennis and Badminton under the premise that the students might misuse them. The indoor sports segment including Martial Arts, Yoga, Zumba instructors were not factored into this semester’s budget and hence **could not be fulfilled**.

# Coach: Fulfilled
Almost all the teams except for badminton have a coach. However, some teams have a coach on an on-call basis.

# Gym: Not Fulfilled
This point refers to the provision of a separate gym for girls on the ground floor of SAC and separate gym timings for girls along with a female gym instructor. The secretary feels that this point is not feasible because the administration wants all the facilities to be equal among students. As a result, it was decided to put cardio on the first floor and weight training below because girls would rather work on cardio. New treadmills are being installed on the first floor to accommodate for the higher crowd that cardio garners.


# Increase Outside Participation: Fulfilled
The sports captains have a calendar of all tournaments and events coming in the semester. This increased outside participation, with prior information, there was good practice. Our teams attended BOSM, MEC, CBIT, and IITH. We have also seen an increase in medals this semester. Our teams have earned 14 medals over the course of this semester, which they usually earn over the duration of a year.

# Dietician and Nutritionist: Not Fulfilled
This was a reiterated point in the manifesto. Firstly, they couldn’t add the expense to the budget for the first semester. Secondly, women dieticians/nutritionists aren’t ready to come as far as our campus when they were reached out. 

# Cycle Marathons: Not Fulfilled
Instead of the original point, the Secretary intends on conducting a Duathlon during arena which would not with be partnering with Cykul as they are not in touch anymore. Once a deal is worked out with, she intends to conduct two or three marathons.

# Outside the Manifesto:
The Sports Secretary also talked to us about other general issues on compus. 

* The participation during the Independence Day Run spiked from 40-50 participants to 200+.
* **SAC Equipment Changes**: This year the administration has put in a lot of effort with changing and adding gym equipment.
* **Red Bull Tournament**: The two sports secretaries together helped organise the Futsal and Badminton tournaments in collaboration with RedBull.
* **Devil’s Circuit Campus Frenzy**: This semester Devil’s circuit saw participation from a BITS contingent 

The Sports Secretary also said that she believes that our sports teams are improving - BPHC won every single one of the friendly matches with IITH. The medals earned by our sports teams are increasing exponentially, as they are encouraged to participate in more tournaments and events. The Sports Secretary also mentioned that in the budget for the next semester, the prize money for events during Arena has been increased.
