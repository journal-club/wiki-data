# Campus Health Improvement
## Student Health Council (Not Fulfilled)
A formal committee is not yet constituted. The work of this committee was to spread awareness and ensure proper healthcare of the students on campus.

## Mental Health (In Progress)
The  SU has been in talks with psychologists who can train the faculty in handling students with mental stress and depression. An app is being developed to hear the grievances of any student facing mental trauma. This will directly connect the student to a faculty trained for handling such situations and the student shall remain anonymous.

## Physical Health  (Fulfilled) 
Various health camps were organised. Blood Donation drive in collaboration with NSS and Eye-Check up Camp in collaboration with Administration.

# Skill Development Program 
## Professional Classes (Not Fulfilled)
The original plan was to conduct a survey with the general body regarding their interests and skills and thus invite professionals/teachers to take up classes for the same, for example, if a majority of the General Body wanted to learn Guitar, arrangements for the same would have been accordingly. It was not taken up this semester due to other engagements of the General Secretary.
# Food Standards Improvement:
## Food Outlet Committee (Fulfilled)                                                                           
A formal committee was constituted to look into the matters related to the eateries on campus. The committee consists of all the H-Reps and has so far issued notices to food outlets through the Administration mostly related to hygiene issues. They are also looking to bring better food outlets on campus.

# Improving Living Standards:
## Common Room Meets (Not asked)
The manifesto of the Secretary promised frequent common room meetings to know the grievances of the general body on matters regarding the campus in general or about their bhavans. This was planned to happen under the supervision of the warden. No such meetings seem to have taken place.

## Internet Connectivity on Campus (In Progress) 
Providing WIFI in Ram and Krishna Bhavans. New routers have been installed and the bandwidth increased from 675 mbps to 1 gbps. Work is going on to replace the old network switches (25% completed). After which the speed is expected to increase. Cyberoam is being replaced with another software for better internet connectivity.

## Survey in CP (In Progress)
The point aims at understanding the problems or shortcomings faced by the shops at CP by being in constant communication with them. Recently, a survey was conducted in CP. An issue came up regarding the laundry service. Currently the washing machines in use are coin operated and there seem to be some problems regarding the same. Replacing these machines is being thought of as an alternative. 

# General Issues:
## Proper Scheduling of T-Shirts (No Update)
The plan was to draft a schedule for all the clubs, departments and associations to release their T-Shirts. This will be done at the the beginning of the year. 

## SAC (No Update)
The Secretary put forth this agenda many times during his campaigning period, promising to speak to the concerned authorities to keep the SAC functional throughout the day and also extend the gym timings.

## Academic Awards (Not asked)
The proposal was to introduce new awards during the convocation ceremony namely - 
‘Best Undergraduate Research Project’ award from each Department.
‘Best Post - Graduate Research Project’ award.
‘Best Thesis’ award to Ph.D students from each department.  

## Research Portal (Not Fulfilled)
The aim was to set up an independant database to maintain the repository of profiles of the profiles and information regarding research works of the students and faculty. A plan has been formulated for the same, it will most likely be in action by the next semester.

## Platform for Alumni Relations and Feedback (Not Fulfilled) 
This was supposed to come up on the SU Portal. The Portal is still under development. This point was actually aimed at helping out students by making a database of all the experiences and suggestions of Seniors or Alumni through a seperate section made in the SU portal solely for this purpose instead of fishing through platforms like Facebook about them.  

# Campus Culture:
## Intranet Podcast (In Progress)
According to the General Secretary, the Intranet Podcast is almost ready. Trials are going on and he is positive that it will become functional at the start of next semester. Through the podcasts anyone on campus will be able to voice their opinions on SU or in general. He claims the SUC will connect to campus though these podcasts. As stated already in his manifesto, it will be a good platform for seniors to share their experiences and also for clubs or societies to hold weekly programs. 

Sharing Minutes of SU/SMC weekly (Not Fulfilled)
In the General Secretary’s duties, he mentioned that the SUC will have fixed weekly meeting to discuss work progress and upcoming initiatives. He also claimed that some of the elected representatives from the SUC or SMC would be nominated to form a committee that will keep the general body updated about the the minutes from the weekly meetings of the SUC or the SMC. But as per the General Secretary, the SUC never had a formal meet till date and that they will start this practise once they have one. He also claims that the Intranet Podcasts will be used by the SUC to inform the general body about the same.

# Outside The Manifesto
Other than working on points from his manifesto, the General Secretary said that he worked on these initiatives on campus as well:
* The drains surrounding the football and hockey fields have been covered with grills in the wake of serious injuries to people who fell in them accidentally.
* The number of solar panels on old hostels is being increased to ensure better supply of hot water in hostels.
* Swiggy was brought to campus.
