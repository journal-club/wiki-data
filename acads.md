<!-- SUBTITLE: A description of how the undergraduate degrees at BITS Hyderabad, BE (hons) and MSc (hons) work.  -->
# Introduction
BITS offers two types of degrees at the undergraduate level, BE (hons) and MSc (hons). Students who meet the admission requirements, and have a high enough BITSAT score are offered admission to one of these programs. A BE degree generally takes four years of study on campus, while an MSc degree (dual degree) takes 5 years. There are two semesters in a year. At the beginning of each semester, you have to register for courses you wish to pursue that semester and prepare your time-table. During the semester, there will be multiple evaluation components, such as a mid-semester exams, surprise quizzes or tests, lab evaluations and assignments. At the end of each semester, you have comprehensive exams ("compres") that are usually 1.5 hours to 3 hours long and carry a heavy weightage toward your final grade. After the compres end, when you are at home for holidays, your grades are released online through the ERP portal. Grades are usually released about fifteen days after semester ends.

# Timetable and Registration
## Preparation of Timetable
Before the beginning of a semester, a draft timetable is usually prepared and sent to all students, asking for feedback on timing of classes. Based on the feedback received, and the feasibility of the requests, a final timetable is sent to students about two weeks before the beginning of the subsequent semester. For newly-joining first-years, however, a physical hard copy of the timetable is given during admission, and instructions on how to register is given during the orientation.

## Registration Through ERP
Registration for courses is done through the ERP portal. Before registration begins, all students are randomly allotted a **PR number**, which decides what time slot you'll be registering in. People with a small PR number register in the first slot, while people with large PR numbers register in the last slot. Usually, there are 3-4 time slots in which you can register. As courses are assigned on a first come-first serve basis, people lucky enough to be in the first time slot usually get the courses they desire. This system is said to be "fair" as your PR number "averages" out in the long run.
