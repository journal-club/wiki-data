<!-- SUBTITLE: List of student and official organisations/bodies at BITS Hyderabad. -->

Student organisations at BITS Hyderabad are mostly of three types - clubs, which are usually focussed on extracurricular activities like dance, music, and drama; departments, which primarily work for the fests ARENA, ATMOS, and Pearl; Tech Associations which are mainly focussed on working in a specific area of science or technology. Other than this, there are official bodies like the Election Commission and CRC, divisions that help the administration in working with students (SWD/AD/IPC) and other societies.
