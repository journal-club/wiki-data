# Activities
## Whispers in the Woods
Whispers in the Woods is the bi-semesterly newsletter of the campus, with the first issue being published in the first semester of the academic year 2017-18. Some issues of the newsletter are printed on newspaper size sheets, while others are released digitally (through publication services such as Joomag). The archives of WITW are available [here](/news/witw).

## The News Not Reported
The News Not Reported (or TNNR) is a video journalism initiative to capture events on campus. Done in collaboration with [Department of Visual Effects](/orgs/dove), the videos are released from JC's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChCi1W0W2yJ7brmuPs2NJlw). 

## Fest Magazines
Journal Club publishes newsletters on the major fests on campus, Atmos, Pearl and Arena, as well Verba Maximus. Fest magazines are initially released in the form of images with text on them, via Facebook. Fest mags are sometimes split into two parts - a pre-fest and a post-fest magazine, with the pre-fest one being released 2-5 days before the fest, and the post-fest magazine being published sometime later. Fest magazines are also available in the [archives](/news/fests), in both plain text format and downloadable PDF format.

## Events during Fests
JC organises events during [Pearl](/fests/pearl) and [Verba Maximus](/fests/vm).

List of events conducted by JC:

- [Time Machine](/fests/pearl/events/time-machine), writing a news report on events in an alternate timeline.
- [Football Manager](/fests/pearl/events/football-manager), simulate a football match by swapping players and building teams. 
- [Bullseye](/fests/pearl/events/bullseye), a word-building game similar to Spellathon (in ToI newspaper), but more complex.
- Caption It, an online event where you have to think of witty captions for images.
- Stonefaced, a VM'18 event where participants have to read funny newspaper headlines with a poker face.
