<!-- TITLE: Csa -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The Computer Science Association or CSA is the representative body of the CS department on campus -->


The Computer Science Association or the CSA acts as a bridge between the Computer Science department and the students pursuing CS on campus. Part of the Atmos FOB, CSA hosts and conducts a lot of talks, competitions and workshops during Atmos. [Algomaniac](https://wiki.bits-hyd.org/fests/atmos/events/Algomaniac) is CSA's flagship competition, and has been the most successful competition in terms of attendance since it's inception. [CodeJam](https://wiki.bits-hyd.org/fests/atmos/events/Code_jam) is the flagship coding event of Atmos. CSA has fun events for non-coders too, [Googled](https://wiki.bits-hyd.org/fests/atmos/events/Googled) being the most famous.

# Work apart from fests

CSA is also a part of TechWeek, in which Technical Assocs contribute their bit to help develop the technical culture on campus. Workshops on GitHub along with workshops on Django and Competitive Coding were held last year. Various talks are held too to spread awareness and exposure to various developments in technology. Codejam, the one like the Atmos event, is held once a semester in the IPC lab. Also CSA conducts the CS Faculty-Student interaction at the beginning of every semester, right before its inductions, to break the ice with the new batch


# Inductions

A crucial part of every Technical Assoc is to pass the baton down to the upcoming batches. CSA, being no different, holds it's inductions roughly a week after it's faculty interaction. Needless to say, only CS pursuing students are invited.


# Post Holders

The CSA is currently headed by [Aayush Jain](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009533955494) (President) and [Kaustubh Welankar](https://www.facebook.com/kaustubh.welankar) (Secretary), both students of the 2016 batch.
