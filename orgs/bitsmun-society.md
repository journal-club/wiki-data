<!-- SUBTITLE: BITSMUN Society is the MUNning society of our campus. -->

One of BITSMUN Society's biggest activity every year is organising the three day MUN conference [BITSMUN Hyderabad](/fests/bitsmun), which is usually conducted in the first semester of the academic year. Other than this, the society also organises MockMUNs (internal MUNs for students on campus to learn more about MUNning) and group discussions on international relations and policy.
