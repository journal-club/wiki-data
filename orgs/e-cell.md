<!-- SUBTITLE: E-Cell is the entrepreneurship cell of BITS Hyderabad.-->

E-Cell 's main activities are organising [LaunchPad](/fests/launchpad), the entreprenurial summit of BPHC, organising events such as [Manager's Dilemma](/fests/atmos/events/managers-dilemma) and [Suit-Up](/fests/atmos/events/SuitUp) in ATMOS, and conducting events throughout the year like Managing Temptations, Coffee with CEL and organising skill development workshops. 

# Managing Temptations
Managing Temptations, usually conducted as a pre-ATMOS event, is a competition in which participants compete to maximise the profit of a food outlet on campus. In 2014 and 2015, [Viceroy](/campus/viceroy) hosted the event, and in 2017, [C3](/campus/c3) hosted the event. In this event, participants register in groups of 3-4 people and are given a two-hour slot to manage the food outlet. The team that manages to generate the maximum profit for the food outlet wins. Teams participating in the event use strategies like offering free room delivery, conducting a music JAM, releasing publicity posters on FEG, and making combos at discounted rates.
