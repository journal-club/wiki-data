## Kritika Kasliwal
**What clubs and departments have you worked with so far?**
I have been the Joint Secretary for the Dramatics Club for this year, I was the Athletics Captain and the Football Vice-captain, other than that I was in the TedX OC, Pearl OC, Verba Maximus '17 and '18 OC, BITSMUN OC and part of the ACE Editorial Board.

**How do you think these credentials would help you in the leadership department?**
For the VM, TEDx and pearl OC, I was part of the logistics for all so I had a lot of interaction students from different departments which has given me a lot of exposure as to how to arrange for various needs and now I have a clear picture of how a fest runs and being the Joint Secretary of a performing club taught me a lot about performing, leadership and time management. Also, being the Athletics Captain, I saw a lot of potential in the sports arena for girls who probably never thought of trying out a sport.  The sporting culture in general has seen a lot of enhancement in the girls in the past year, but still needs a lot of work. We started a football team from scratch that, and had 4 teams participating in Arena, and we had a team of 16 people from a group of people in which only a very few had any sporting history,so I think that has been a great experience that has taught me a lot.

**You said that the culture for sports among girls is not that great, which is not up to par yet, so do you have any kind of plans for that right now?**
What Iâ€™ve noticed in this past year  a lot of people bringing up new ideas of their own so  I would want to go through this process with the team right from its inception so they can focus on the game and the rest is taken care of for them.  The workshops should be well planned so as to maximise participation and avoid clashes. There is a lot of scope for girls' sports and we can harvest the potential with the right resources and process.
