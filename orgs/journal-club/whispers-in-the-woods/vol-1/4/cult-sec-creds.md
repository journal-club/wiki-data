## Eti Singh
**What clubs and departments have you worked for?**
I’ve been a part of Hindi Tarang and Dramatics Club since my first year. I’m a core member of Dramatics Club and Joint Secretary of Hindi Tarang. I have worked informally departments.

**What kind of leadership experience do you have?**
I’ve been the JointSec of Hindi Tarang this year, and other than this I’ve been OC head for Crimson Curtain 2018 and Fervour 2017, and was also a part of the BITSMUN OC. I’m the student coordinator for my regional assoc, Sangam, and am a nucleus member in ACE, the Association of Chemical Engineers. I was also a part of VM OC, and organized the Youth Mahasabha during VM.

**How do you think your previous experience will make you a better leader once you’re elected?**
Since I’ve been around this scenario from day one, organizing events and thinking of creative ideas to improve clubs, so I have a good idea of what the fallouts will be. This Pearl I organized eight events, out of which two were headliners, one was a brand new event and one a pro show. As a post-holder in Hindi Tarang, I organized Ukti, Alfaaz, Anthakshari and Youth Mahasabha. Alfaaz is a new event, which had regional rounds and 40+ participants, with the finals being judged by five judges. I helped organize Natya Shastra, Mono Acting, and the pro-show Barrf, which requires a lot of planning.

**What is your general vision?**
I want people to explore more and try out new things and get the best out of the college experience. At the same time my priority would be not just to maintain the quality of the clubs but also boost the level of cultural activities happening on campus

**What clubs and departments have you worked for?**
I've worked for DePP, DoVE, Firewallz. When it comes to clubs, I've worked for the Journal Club, VfX, Fashion Society. I was part of the Verba Maximus OC. 

**What kind of leadership experience do you have? **
I'm currently a part of the Student Mess Council. Managing a campus of 3500 students on the issues of food can be very difficult and working for takes a lot of skill and patience. 

**How do you think your previous experience will make you a better leader once you’re elected?**
From the department point of view have worked for all the fests. I've also worked for Glitterati and Mr. and Ms. Pearl. I've also worked under the FOB and the previous Cultural Secretary. Working alongside the previous Cultural Secretary has helped me understand what the post is all about and their responsibilities. 

**Apart from the clubs and departments what else have you worked for?**  
I took up the initiative to put up the Anaemia counter in the mess after it was found that a lot of students suffer from anaemia after the health check-up 

**What is the vision that you have for our campus?**
I believe that culture is not just about performing on stage. Take the example of organizing a talk or an event, to inculcate in the minds of the students to attend important talks or events also accounts as culture for me. It doesn't just have to be restricted to the technical or literary side of things, for me it is about the campus culture as a whole.
