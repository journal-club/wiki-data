ATMOS has been known across universities for a plethora of workshops and exciting competitions, specifically aimed at developing and cultivating interest for technology among those attending it. Over the years, ATMOS carved out a niche for itself among the many tech-fests in India.  Honoring its glorious past, ATMOS’18 has been organized in such a way that its going to live up to the high expectations on it which keep growing higher every year.

# Hopes From The Sixth Dimension
**A look at Freshers Expectation of Atmos'18**:

* I’m excited for the competitions-especially Robowars, MiniGP and Game of Drones. Can’t wait for the pro-shows either as I’ve never been to one before. ***-Tarun Agarwal***

* I believe that our first fest is a great opportunity for us to bond with our batch-mates as well as seniors through department and clubs. It’s also a great learning experience for people coming from varied backgrounds. I can’t wait to go for the pro-shows, dandiya night, stand-up and the magic show. I’m hoping all my expectations coming true. ***-Anirudh Parekh***

* After 2 years of burning the midnight oil, the thing I was looking forward to most was the supposedly amazing college life that was to follow. Being admitted in a college of such repute- whose upcoming technical fest is considered to be the best in South India, I feel like my best days in BPHC are going to come soon. The expectations are high and why not. We are definitely going to go sleepless those 3 days and have the time of our lives. ***-Shreejee Goyal***

* I expect a boost in start-up culture from the management and finance events as I dream of starting one. I also hope this fest enhances the awareness about AI on campus. Other than this, I want 'Nagin Dance' on EDM night, loads of food, dance and fun. ***-Kanishk Pathak***

* I feel that being a part of the first campus fest will truly transform me from being a fresher to a BITSian in a true sense. I expect the campus to more lively than it already is, owing to the numerous students coming to the campus from different parts of the country. ***-Saandra Nandakumar***

* I want to attend workshops to have a better insight into the technical world and learn exciting, new things. ***-Rupangi Agrawal***
