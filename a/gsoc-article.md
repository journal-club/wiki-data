<!-- TITLE: GSoC: A Peek into Open Source Coding -->
<!-- SUBTITLE:  -->

# Introduction
Google Summer of Code (popularly abbreviated as GSoC) is a global program which provides a platform for students to contribute to open source software development. It was founded by none other than Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2005.
Participating in GSoC has so many perks that it would be completely pointless to even try to name them all. For starters it includes a neat $2400 cheque, but more important ones would be the GSoC tag (which is a hallmark for open source coders), and the valuable friends a student makes during GSoC days, which go a long way. Some of the people the student gets to know during his/her GSoC days are so famous and influential that a letter of recommendation from them  would be an extremely valuable asset !

# How to apply for GSoC?
Every year, after the announcement of the programme, open source organisations submit their applications to be selected as mentoring organisations. Google decides the organisations that would be participating in that year’s GSoC. Students submit their proposals to work on projects of their interests in ‘at most’ three organisations, and finally, students get to work on one project only. Selected students then code throughout their summer to complete their projects and are assisted by their mentors.
We got the opportunity to talk to Kumar Prasun, who got selected for GSoC at the end of his second year (summer of ‘17) and Rohitt Vashishtha, who got selected for Zulip Summer of Code (ZSoC) in summer ‘17. We spoke on everything ranging from the technical aspects of open source contribution to the problems and the fun moments during their three months of GSoC/ZSoC.

# What motivated you guys to plunge into the world of open source programming and apply for GSoC/ZSoC?
As Kumar puts it, people who get selected for GSoC  become a beacon for other people who are even slightly inclined towards open source coding, and in his case, this beacon was Arnav Dhamija (who was selected for the google summer of code at the ending of first year itself !).  Also, according to him, participating in GSoC gives the coder a sense of validation for all of those years of hard work. 
On the other hand, Rohitt started coding early and fell in love with it. By the time he joined college, he had already started exploring the world of open source coding. He started off with java and all that he was able to learn and create was because of other people posting open source codes on sites like github. This is what got him to plunge deeper into open source coding.
