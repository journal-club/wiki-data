<!-- TITLE: GSoC: A Peek into Open Source Coding -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: An interview with Rohitt and Kumar Prasun -->
## Introduction
Google Summer of Code (popularly abbreviated as GSoC) is a global program which provides a platform for students to contribute to open source software development. It was founded by none other than Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2005.
Participating in GSoC has so many perks that it would be completely pointless to even try to name them all. For starters it includes a neat $2400 cheque, but more important ones would be the GSoC tag (which is a hallmark for open source coders), and the valuable friends a student makes during GSoC days, which go a long way. Some of the people the student gets to know during his/her GSoC days are so famous and influential that a letter of recommendation from them  would be an extremely valuable asset !

## How to apply for GSoC?
Every year, after the announcement of the programme, open source organisations submit their applications to be selected as mentoring organisations. Google decides the organisations that would be participating in that year’s GSoC. Students submit their proposals to work on projects of their interests in ‘at most’ three organisations, and finally, students get to work on one project only. Selected students then code throughout their summer to complete their projects and are assisted by their mentors.
We got the opportunity to talk to Kumar Prasun, who got selected for GSoC at the end of his second year (summer of ‘17) and Rohitt Vashishtha, who got selected for Zulip Summer of Code (ZSoC) in summer ‘17. We spoke on everything ranging from the technical aspects of open source contribution to the problems and the fun moments during their three months of GSoC/ZSoC.

## What motivated you guys to plunge into the world of open source programming and apply for GSoC/ZSoC?
As Kumar puts it, people who get selected for GSoC become a beacon for other people who are even slightly inclined towards open source coding, and in his case, this beacon was Arnav Dhamija (who was selected for the GSoC at the ending of first year itself!).  Also, according to him, participating in GSoC gives the coder a sense of validation for all of those years of hard work. 

On the other hand, Rohitt started coding early and fell in love with it. By the time he joined college, he had already started exploring the world of open source coding. He started off with java and all that he was able to learn and create was because of other people posting open source codes on sites like github. This is what got him to plunge deeper into open source coding.
## What is the main difference between open source coding and competitive coding?
Both of them tried to explain open source coding to us in layman’s terms. In open source coding, one basically makes his/her own project and uploads it on web based services like github. This enables the entire github community to be able to view his project.  In a case where somebody wants an extra feature in the project ( or if somebody finds a bug), he/she can make the required changes in the code to implement that feature. In this way, the initial code is now optimized and also has new features.
Competitive coding on the other hand, enables you to dig deeper into one specific language and helps you develop problem solving skills. It helps one to churn out code faster and get good at analyzing and solving problems quickly.

## How rigorous were those three months of GSoC/ZSoC? To what extent were your limits pushed?

Both Rohitt and Kumar were selected for ZSoC / GSoC at the end of their second year, which meant that had their PS1 along with this. They described their experience to be both good and bad at the same time. Both of them had to face a lot of problems at their PS stations, and managing their work week along with close to 40 hrs of coding per week proved to be a tad bit hectic for them. Albeit, they thoroughly enjoyed the time when they used to code and thinking of those days brings a smile on their face. They made valuable contacts and interacted with several people.

## What does a mentor do and what are the perks associated with mentorship?
A mentor’s role varies widely across different organisations and students. When the student gets stuck on piece of code, often it is the mentor who tells him where he went wrong or what material he/she should be learning to rectify their mistakes. Also, the primary goal of a mentor is to review the code written by the student , to eradicate all the small mistakes and bugs.

Although mentoring is usually unpaid, it also has huge perks associated with it. For starters, some mentors get to attend a 4-day mentor summit at the google’s mountain view and San Francisco campuses. The summit in itself, is an entirely different experience. One gets to meet other mentors and admins of various organizations and also Google employees associated with the open source world. In addition to this, there are cool merchandise and goodies on offer. Rohitt also happened to mentor for Google Code-In (GCI), which is basically a GSoC type event for high school students. GCI also has similar perks attached to it.

## What advice would you like to give to people who are inclined towards contributing to open source code?
Both of them agree on the fact that dedication is the key to excel in the field of open source coding. There are times when one may be stuck on a piece of code for several days altogether, at this point one should not give up. There is immense satisfaction when your code is accepted for the first time. That very point where people tend to give up, acts like a threshold. All one has to do is to cross that one threshold. Rohitt also suggests that one must start contributing to college projects. While contributing to college projects, even if somebody makes a mistake in their code, it is not scrutinised unlike the real world. Rather, seniors in the campus would be happy to help and guide you. Contributing to college projects can be seen as a first step before going on to contribute to other open source projects.


*We are extremely thankful to Rohitt Vashishtha and Kumar Prasun for sharing with us their experiences.*
