The Economics Association is always on the lookout to help improve the not so technical culture and sends participants to the fests of top B-Schools of the country. They are looking forward to their fest, Finnovate, which is an economics and finance conclave to improve the culture in this field.

# Crux
The Programming and Computing Club of the campus started the semester with orientations and workshops for providing basic knowledge about programming to complete beginners. ‘ATMOS Codedash’ the premier competitive coding event, ‘Capture the flag’- a security challenge, ‘Binary Battles’- a tournament style competitive coding event in association with CSA and the 3rd edition of ‘PyBITS’ are the events which are being organized by the club this ATMOS. The two-day event ‘PyBITS’ comprising of workshops for all levels of Python enthusiasts, a conference and a developer sprint will be conducted.

Apart from the events throughout the year, Crux has been organizing workshops on different domains such as Python, JavaScript, competitive programming, web development, etc. The club’s Facebook groups regularly upload tutorials and assignments thus increasing the activity. Though it’s usually the club members working on open source projects, the club is open to and expects participation from all students in these projects and other peer-to-peer learning sessions. With hackathons conducted by the club and other external companies throughout the year, there is a lot of scope for the improvement in participation. The students take part in world renowned events like ACM ICPC, GSoC, etc. and prestigious hackathons and the output gets better each year. Crux is of the opinion that though there is a lot of participation in coding activities, the tech culture can improve multiple fold if things are done together as a community with a lot of interaction and engagement.
