<!-- SUBTITLE: Here's what Siddharth Sampath, Editor In Chief of the ATMOS 2018 pre-fest magazine, has to say about the efforts put into it. -->

ATMOS has been known across universities for a plethora of workshops and exciting competitions, specifically designed to develop and cultivate interest for technology among those attending it. Over the years, ATMOS carved out a niche for itself among the many tech-fests in India.  Honoring its glorious past, ATMOS’18 has been organized in such a way that its going to live up to the high expectations on it which keep growing higher every year. 
We at the Journal Club present to you the first version of Technocrat. I can only thank the writers and editors for their dedication to bring you this magazine.  Finally, let’s brace ourselves for entering a new dimension of reality, one which comprises of an Assimilation of Technically Motivated Souls.

Regards
Siddharth Sampath
