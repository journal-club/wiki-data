<!-- TITLE: Design, well-done.-->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A talk with Tushar Kanth, Secretary of Design Club, BPHC (2017-18) on poster design and more. -->

All of us have seen posters and artworks from the ATMOS, ARENA and Pearl pages published over the years. All of these are well appreciated by everyone who sees them. They often bring up thoughts along the lines of “How can one make such beautiful designs?” The people working behind the scenes are not your average designers.
 
The Department of Technical Arts, or DoTA, as we call it, is the department which is responsible for a lot of things related to these fests. A usual misunderstanding amongst people is that this department just designs the logo, the posters and the website. This is just a small part of branding fests, the department does a lot more than that. DoTA’s work involves creating a sponsorship brochure, which is used by DoSM for pitching. It also manages the creation of event posters, banners and passes which DePP uses to publicise the fest more effectively. The fest based merchandise designs for BPHC are also made by the department. DoTA has played a pivotal role in making the design culture on campus flourish. This is supplemented by the fact that it always tries to improve upon the quality of the content it puts out every year. This article tries to throw some light on how this culture grew and why it's important to keep up this growth for subsequent years.

For a long time, designs made by students on campus lacked both purpose and quality. That was brought to a close during Pearl 2015. One of the major misconceptions when it comes to designing is that throwing in a lot of colours and various fonts can make anything attractive.

But think of it this way: What would you like to see?

Now compare these all event posters. Which is more preferable on our fest pages?

One of the golden rules followed by professional graphic designers is that design should serve the purpose of showing required information in a minimalistic fashion, using **low amounts of text and colours** to avoid overcrowding. This was noted by our seniors, like Mohammad Owais Shaik and Andey Harsha, to name a few. Consequently, they started to learn and use the design practices followed by professional graphic designers.  This helped them express creative ideas through superior technique, the results were encouraging. There was a telling improvement in those posters when compared to previous years. This inspired them to improve themselves, thereby improving the overall quality in the works produced by DoTA.

Since then, with every batch came new designers who always went through the process of learning the basics of designing while observing different artworks made by professional designers. This helped them incorporate novel effects in the work for DoTA while keeping recent design trends in mind. The designers at DoTA go through this process every single time to make sure that the work which comes out as a mark of DoTA, in fact BPHC as a whole, is top notch.  A good design is not a random mix of text and colours, every element should serve a purpose. It should not be overwhelming but catchy at the same time, getting this balance right is not as easy as people think it is. There is stress upon the designers to create a good design/artwork in the narrow deadlines provided. The integrity of the designer plays an important role in creating an original and effective design which serves the purpose in a creative manner. This dedication is what makes every work of DoTA, be it a poster or a website, distinct from others and enhances our fests’ reputation. The difference is evident when one compares our designs to those of other colleges. And mind you, the designers at DoTA aren't all immensely talented prodigies. They are just a bunch of students who just care about aesthetics, know a little about tools used for graphic designing and have some experience with creating things.

The ripples have slowly spread from exclusive fest related posts to smaller events and stand-alone talks. This just shows that the growth of the design culture in BPHC has been tremendous and is still going strong. All those posts for various events on FEG, Shoutbox and our fest pages stand as proof of the quality of our artwork which is not only comparable, but better than most well known college fests in India. And this culture, this practice is something which has to keep improving as the years pass by. We have carved ourselves a niche in this respect, expectations are created to be upheld, and BPHC will definitely keeping proving itself time and time again. It is an identity which we cannot afford to lose. Why should we keep improving? Deep statements aside, a good design is always appreciated.
