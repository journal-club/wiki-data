Reaching Medak, the first thing to do would be to visit the Medak Church.This church is said to be one of the largest in Asia. Its rich history, the style of architecture and the old Victorian vibe is sure to enthral your senses. Built by Charles Walker Posnett, a British Wesleyan Methodist in 1924, it is the single largest Diocese in Asia and the second largest in the world. A Diocese is a district under the Pastoral care of the bishop in the Christian Church.
 


The next stop after the Church would be the Medak Fort. The Fort has immense significance in the history of Medak. It was built by The Kakatiya king Prataparudra I in the 12th century and has since been occupied by several kings. The present fort is in ruins which adds to the rustic feel of the town.The main attractions in the fort are the three gates and the cannon.The three gates the Prathama Dwaram, the Simha Dwaram and the Gaja Dwaram each have their own significance.

If there is still time then you can head to Pocharam. Located at a distance of 16 km from Medak, the trip would take about 2-3 hours including travel. The major attractions here are the Pocharam Dam and the Pocharam wildlife sanctuary. The dam has been constructed on river Alair which is a tributary of the Manjira river. The wildlife sanctuary is open between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM.

The flowing water adds to the serenity of the place which makes travelling all the way there for a sunset more than just worth it. The evening rays splashing on top of the running water bringing out different hues is a magical sight to witness. The sanctuary also has a watchtower and an eco-tourism spot. There is also a boating facility here. 

If you intend to stay the night here then there are quite a few decent hotels in Medak but the Haritha hotel managed by the Telangana Tourism would be the best option. 

Happy Travelling.
