<!-- TITLE: Editor's Note -->

A backpack, curiosity and high excitement is sometimes all you need to set forth on an adventure, to venture into the unknown cultures of the world, to tease apart what nature has to offer. In the course of a journey you might end up in a place that feels otherworldly and exotic or a place that makes you wonder if you ever left home to begin with.

The allure of a new location however, is incomplete without its people, the embodiments of its spirit. The quest to explore people and their cultures, places and their beauty, earth and itâ€™s extravagance is what wanderlust is all about.

With wanderlust as the theme Pearl 2018 gives you a chance to meet new people and experience new things, all while invoking a sense of nostalgia for the travels that have been.
In this magazine, as editors, we tried to present to you all that is in store for you this Pearl. Putting together this magazine was a herculean task, and we enjoyed every little bit of it.  It wouldn't have been possible without a talented team of writers, editors and designers backing us. We hope that you enjoy reading it as much as we did creating it.
