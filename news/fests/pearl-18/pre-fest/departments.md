<!-- TITLE: Departments -->

**DEPP**
The members of the Department of Publicity and Public Relations are all set to pull off a great Pearl this year. With a great team working round the clock, the department has surely witnessed an elevated level of enthusiasm and fervor this year. With over 9000 PR calls and hundreds of posts put up on various online platforms, students across the country know where to spend their precious weekend this March. Right from the inception of what appears to be a three-month mission, the team has been constantly been pushing themselves far beyond the vast depths of space, pushing quality and quantity to finesse.


**DoPE**
A department that was formulated last semester, DoPE, a brainchild of our president, has already proved its worth in Atmos and Arena. This Pearl, they have pulled out all stops by bringing us a lineup of a variety of international and local artists and have made sure that every genre is recognized and accounted for. This is the result of endless hours dedicated on research and in contacting the various artists through somewhat tedious channels and cumbersome channels. They have pushed through the difficulties and are looking to emerge victorious as we gear up for a fest of spectacular extravaganza.

**DOSM**
Pearl is a huge fest and undoubtedly a tremendous amount of pressure is put on DoSMites for the sponsorship. Yet again, the department has proved its mettle by raising sponsorship for Pearl'18  which is rumoured to be greater than the previous editions of Pearl. DoSM is one department which has to work all year long just to see the fest reach new heights and live up to the expectations of all. With Pearl fast approaching, the team is both edgy and elevated at the same time. DoSM is very happy with its work and it just can’t wait to watch Pearl, for which it has been working tirelessly!

**DoTA**
DoTA, the Department of Technical Arts is the one of the most crucial departments that organize our college fests. They provide the necessary online presence that include posters, websites and an Android App containing various details about the fest. For this Pearl too they have upped their game with a mind-blowing website and the amazing posters which they have worked on along with the DA (Designers Anonymous). The amount of efforts, they have put in this time to ensure a wonderful Pearl’18, is truly remarkable. The variety and uniqueness has surely evoked an interest in the visitors and hence, this Pearl as it appears to be has huge expectations in terms of its scale and the number of attendees.
