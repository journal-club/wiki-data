<!-- TITLE:The Ultimate Travel Guide -->

There are certain times in life, dear reader…when one’s sole ambition is to stagger across to a corner and become one with The Couch. One plops down with a deep sigh, and steadily enough…the lines between the fabric and the buttocks begin to blur into nothingness. Behold in your mind’s eye- The Lump.

One of my dearest friends, I am proud to tell you, has managed to achieve this state of perfect Lumpiness. He is now honorably indistinguishable from the sofa. He spoke to me yesterday, and his words were wise indeed. At his earnest request, I will now share his advice for the greater good of humankind. He seemed very enthusiastic about it; I distinctly heard him sigh. And sighing is the Lump’s symbol of Zest. So here goes: The Lump’s Travelling Tips. It will be of immense use, I imagine.

* If you ever wish to witness the delicate rising sun and its exquisite glory in the wee hours of dawn…then stop wishing it. If there is even the tiniest inclination in your soul to wake up before your ankles are physically yanked off the bed by angry mobs, then the Lump is afraid to say, dear reader, that you are a ghoul and a blot on the planet.
* Enjoy hiking across the regal green mountains? Love the wind gloriously sweeping across your scalp? Stop lying to yourself- you and the Lump both know that there is nothing more glorious in the world than the wind from opening a bag of potato chips and a soft squishy bed.
* If you’re looking for the best hotel and transport deals during your stay, then look no further for advice. The wise Lump recommends the hotels with complimentary meals of breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in between. As for transport, you shall need only the bellboy to transport you from your bed to the buffet and back. 

My dear friend died soon after he presented these timeless pearls of wisdom to me. In fact, according to expert forensic folklore, he had died a long time ago…but there had been too much inertia for anyone to notice. I heard he was buried with the couch; they were very attached.
