<!-- TITLE:The Traveller -->

There's a different kind of joy
In walking through a forest alone, 
Exploring  with your familial envoy
The culture of far cities unknown, 
In joking around for countless hours 
Neath the stars around a bonfire
The tree of friendship then flowers, 
If road trips are your heart's desire. 
There's a different kind of love 
Sitting on the beach with her 
Watching the sun sink into sea below 
This far from home time begins to blur. 
The excitement of new cuisine 
Scenic views you may never forget
The mountains, seas and all in between 
A Fort, a castle, a tower, a minaret 
There'll always be more to see 
More to taste and more to feel 
Whether you're a lover or a devotee 
Never lose that wanderlust zeal.
