**Devil’s Advocate**

We often come across things that cannot be talked about, things that look one-sided and prejudiced. In such situations, it’s no surprise most of us hedge our opinions by playing our favorite red-tailed villain and voicing our thoughts. In the VM event Devil’s Advocate participants were asked to do just that. They had to put their thinking hats on to go against their innate perception of what is right and defend the ones that are absurdly wrong.

***Journal Club events ***
**Stone Face **
Stone face was the hilarious informal event conducted by journal club in the LTC lobby. The idea of the event was to not give any reaction while reading out a hundred and fifty of the weirdest headlines ever printed. This ludicrous challenge was taken up by loads of student and was a source of continuous laughter. To those few who managed to read all 150 with so much as twitching I sincerely recommend letting go of the internet. 

**Opinion Editorial**
 Journal Club’s headliner event gathered quite the crowd of aware students who took the opportunity to share their views on the several issues that plague our modern society. As the inner journalists raised their heads in glory, we realized anybody can,apart from dancing, be a journalist as well,only if one cared enough. The entries received made us realise that people do care.Period.
