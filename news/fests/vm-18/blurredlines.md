The Illuminati is a secret society which works in the shadows to brainwash you and take over the world.Slowly but Surely. The only thing right in the last sentence is that it is a secret society.The Illuminati was a group of highly intellectual individuals who opposed superstition,obscurantism and religious influence over public life.
The present day Illuminati is believed to consist to the major world leaders who are capable enough to change the course of history.They are believed to part of every major industry in the world ranging from film and music to sports and business.The goal of this society is to establish a “New World Order”.This New World Order talks of an authoritarian government ruling over the entire world.The modern day “Illuminati” is very different from the one established way back in 1776.It is for you to perceive what is fact and what is fiction.
