<!-- TITLE: Proshow -->

Verba Maximus 2018 brought not two of the best comedians on the India circuit together to end the fest in a cacophony of laughter and merriment as Karunesh Talwar and Kunal Kamra joined forces to leave the Auditorium of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus clutching their stomachs from laughter.
One of the most ingenious stand-up actors in the country today, Karunesh Talwar got the show going. Savage heckler put-downs, political quips and relatable jokes developed a great connect between the artist and the audience.
Next came Kunal Kamra, yet another witty and spontaneous artiste. His hilarious punch lines and gags kept the audience hooked as he explored social taboos and ripped into middle-aged 'uncles' and politicians.
The duo ensured that VM '18 ended on the highest of notes, and kept  the crowd going from the beginning until the end of the show.
