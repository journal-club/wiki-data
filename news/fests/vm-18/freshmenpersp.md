<!-- TITLE: Freshmen Perspective -->

**Yasaswi Thota:** 
VM was amazing. I had so much fun! After the monotony of physics and chemistry, it was really refreshing to find a creative outlet to do something different. I participated in Sherlocked and Yin Yang, and I’ve got to hand it to the team, the plot for Sherlocked was just fantastic! I would’ve never expected the turn of events that played out at Sherlocked.

**Nikita Gohel:**
The atmosphere at this VM was electrifying! I participated in Spell Bee, Sherlocked and the Lit Quiz. The Lit Quiz in particular, was a lot of fun. I learnt a lot of stuff that I didn’t know and since I’m really fond of reading, it was very interesting for me. The games being conducted in the lobby really added to the whole experience. Also, the stand-up show was way better than I expected it to be.

**Shreyansh Garg:**
While the plot for Sherlocked was very well thought out, the overwhelming numbers made it a little difficult to participate in the event. Each suspect was surrounded by close to 20 people which made it quite a task to question them. But overall, the event was quite enjoyable. The open mic was really entertaining.

**Utkarsh Shankar:**
Working for VM was a genuine pleasure. What made it so satisfying was seeing the work I did actually creating a difference in the fest. I was inducted for logistics and publicity but I ended up working for every department. I got to see the people I met at the Delhi regionals come down all the way to experience our fest. Lifting benches and mattresses, handling excited participants and judges, and organising events- I think VM gave me a taste of it all. Props to the people that lifted benches with me, because honestly, they did all the heavy lifting.


**Jai Jain:**
I went into VM with no expectations whatsoever. I’d heard a lot of uhh… not-so-positive opinions about the fest from seniors. I attended the debate and VM Slam as a spectator. I was blown away by the level of competition at the debate. And some of the participants slayed with their poetry. I didn’t really enjoy Karunesh Talwar’s show but Kunal Kamra more than made up for that.

**Triyasha:**
I was organising Devil’s Advocate and JAM in VM, but I think I got to play a role in all the facets of organising the fest. The competition at JAM was cutthroat and a midnight final was pretty much the best climax the event could’ve asked for. As for Devil’s Advocate, it was rather interesting watching the participants wrestle with their conscience as they tried to defend some very questionable viewpoints. I think I speak for the entire OC when I say that VM truly felt like it was ours.
