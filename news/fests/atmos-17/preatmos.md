# Pre-Atmos events
## MEA(Mechanical Engineering Association)
For those with a passion and flair for designing and for those who thought designing could not reap benefits, MEA came up with a solid (pun intended!) answer. With CADpro, an exciting design competition, it gave competitors freedom to work with any software of their comfort, like CREO, SolidWorks, and many others to create wonders of all shapes and sizes, and of course, a reward of 1.5k to the best of the bunch.

## ACE( Association of Chemical Engineers)
This time, ACE came up with two innovative pre-Atmos events. The first being a fast-paced treasure hunt called ‘Chamber of  Secrets’ where all the clues that needed to be deciphered were quite technical. The second one was ‘Chemictionary’ which was a fresh version of Pictionary with engineering related words, aptly described as ‘Pictionary for the nerds’.

## CEA( Civil engineering Association)
CEA this year, came up with a novel one-day, free-of-cost designing workshop for Revit. The workshop aimed at educating the students on the various applications of the software like designing buildings and placing various furniture components in it, learning about templates and 3D image rendering along the way.

## WALL STREET CLUB
The Wall Street Club conducted the Mock-Mart - an intricate and witty game to be played by finance-enthusiasts in teams of three. It gave the players a hands-on experience on buying and selling stocks and analyzing market trends, skills the Wall Street Club is known for and actively encourages.

## ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION
The Economics Association conducted an enlightening panel discussion on the generally hitherto unknown concepts and facts of the newly introduced GST. The panelists were all dignitaries and experts in their respective fields and owing to the riveting topic, the event was met with active participation.

## CSA( Computer Science Association)
This year, CSA introduced Mock Algomaniac, a scaled-down version of the superhit actual Algomaniac conducted during Atmos. To make things a bit more interesting this year, the questions were set up by the freshers.

## PRE-FEST PRO SHOW
This year, a pro show was conducted at the auditorium in association with Parx-Hunt. It saw various bands competing for the title of  Best College Bands. The headliner event of the show was a performance by the band, Underground Authority, a neo-epoch rock band that brought to life the theme of this ATMOS - a neon dystopia

## PHoEnix
PHoEnix, this year, brought the Home Automation Workshop to educate the students about automating household electronic devices using simple Wi-fi modems and Arduino Uno boards. It sought to teach the students who had come in teams of three to control their devices using Facebook messages and also to get live updates from the devices directly to their mobile phones.

## ARC( Automation and Robotics club)
The Automation and Robotics Club of our campus organized the Line Followers workshop and the workshop on the beguiling Bomb Squad. It attempted to teach many enthusiastic students about the basics of creating bots for the Atmos event of the same name.

## CRuX
The competitive coding club on campus has always been extra active with its educative sessions on Web and Android developer workshops and competitive coding classes. This year, it organized a workshop on competitive coding, a workshop on Python and also, the Dussehra Hack conducted with the help of the Mozilla Foundation. It taught the students on campus to create their own web extension over a single day. The participants were taught to develop add-ons in teams of four, with exciting prizes for the most creative teams
