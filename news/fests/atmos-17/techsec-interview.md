### What are your expectations for the fest? Are you nervous? Excited? Talk to us about how you’re feeling now, with only a few more days to go.

I’m excited! All the hard work that we have put in for the past five months comes down to this.  We are nervous, but our excitement overshadows our nervousness.  I did suffer from insomnia due to a lot of work, but now I have insomnia due to the excitement.

In my PS, I couldn’t sleep, and even when I could, I used to get nightmares.  I used to discuss in my dreams.  My roommates used to complain that I was shouting at night in my dreams.  My PS was very hectic: the days were 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM.  Phones and laptops weren’t allowed, so all communication had to be done at night, I had to stay up all night, talk to the FOB, and the heads, planning the fest.

This ATMOS will be great: five months of planning went into this, and our efforts will show this.  ATMOS has become a proper brand: we have patronages from Make in India, Startup India, and Digital India.  We have an association with NASSCOM 10,000 Startups for the TechExpo.

### What’s being planned for this year’s TechTainment?
TechTainment is mostly a BITS-only event where you’ll have to build or make a few projects – so far three have been planned: one is the Lightsaber from Star Wars, with an LED strip of lights to give it the glow, with the saber vibrating when it comes in contact, and a 3D printed handle.  Another project is a beat detector which will flicker with varying amounts, according to the frequency and pitch of the music playing around it.  And the third is a hologram to show visuals “The Neon Dystopia”, along with branding for the sponsors.  This is something that is not very common and will be placed in the LTC as well as G102, which is where the Techtainment projects will be displayed.  All these are simple projects, which will help participants learn under the mentorship of ARC.  If these projects are completed before ATMOS, we might even do more.

### How is it like working with such a big Fest Organizing Body? Do you feel that the team experience has added something to the fest that you alone, couldn’t?
It is intense.  There are 12 departments, 14 tech senate bodies and I want everything to go through me. I strictly believe that “Too many cooks spoil the broth”, and the FOB agrees with this. It was a great experience, I have made new and lasting friendships and my patience grew a lot as I had to wait for a long time for confirmation from companies.  It was wonderful working with a team that believed in my vision.  Our Tech Senate is very sensible, and they have a vision of how the fest can improve, and we’ve incorporated most of what they’ve suggested.

If I wanted to publicise an event, I did make a team of DePP members who would do the job for particular events.  I made this kind of a proper roadmap and FOB stood with me.
We have dedicated people in FOB who are really working hard and it all boils down to this.

### The theme for the fest is “A Neon Dystopia”.  How was this chosen to be the theme out of the many possible ideas? Is there a story behind this?
We wanted to show a glimpse into the future and futuristic technology, considering both the dark and the good side of it.  The theme is a reference from Cyberpunk, a genre that focuses on a futuristic dystopia.  There are many Cyberpunk movies which we examined and found to be apt.  It was more than a month of brainstorming.  We started from the evolution: ape to human to robot.

Since I don’t watch a lot of TV shows, I had very little knowledge about this genre, and thus was rather tilted against it.  But I had to adhere to the decision of the FOB, as this is not a dictatorship, so I agreed to the theme.  However,  I didn’t expect this kind of response at all! The Campus loved it!  My only motive was to represent a futuristic world.  Most of the work on the theme was done by FOB.  They brought in the proper names., and decided on the theme.  Although I was apprehensive, initially, I was convinced after knowing more about it.  And the look of the website took away any remaining objections that I had.

### You are a Civil Engineering student, but your main interest is with Robotics.  What advice would you give to students who might want to pursue interests that are different from their branch?
If you have an interest, pursue it!  But don’t neglect your academics.  They’re important and you should be able to manage both equally.  Attend your classes and in your free time, work on your interests.  The journey is hard, there’s no denying, but in due course of time, you’ll be seeing the results which will keep you going.  There are many robotics enthusiasts here including 2nd years who’ll help you if you don’t hesitate and approach them for guidance.

I haven’t taken up even a single project this semester due to my commitment for ATMOS.  I’ll probably get back after ATMOS. As far as Robotics is concerned, from my personal side, I feel that the Robotics and even Coding Culture in the Campus has to grow a lot.  We will have an inter-BITS coding competition.  We had a pre-ATMOS Mozilla Hackathon as well.

### After having been involved in ATMOS for three years, in varying degrees of participation, how do you feel ATMOS has changed you? How much has the fest come to mean to you?
A lot.  It means a lot for me.  I entered this college as a Narayana-Chaitanya product.  I always had a dream to do something related to robotics.  That was my driving motivation in class 12 to study for competitive exams.  Finally, I came here – my score was not very high, so I had to take Civil Engineering: I didn’t know about the Dual Degrees.  Like every other first-year, I dreamt for a verti, then ATMOS happened.  

Our pre-ATMOS events were AMAZING! We had a quadcopter challenge in which Surya Teja Cheedella (who was a GSoCian and Texas Instruments intern) was our mentor.  One morning, we went to test the Quadcopter.  We lost signal from the Quadcopter in the middle due to low battery.  The quadcopter kept on flying and didn’t stop.  We ran behind the quadcopter, trying everything we could, but it kept on flying and went into the jungle-ish area that used to be behind Krishna Bhavan.  We tried going in and searching, but there were a lot of crabs and other stuff, and we couldn’t find it.  Then we thought we should’ve built a Quadcopter with a GPS tracker, and repented.  Now we’re building an autonomous Quadcopter that’ll fly on its own - it’s a long-term project that will probably be ready in a year or so.

During ATMOS ‘16, I was one of the executive body members of the Automation and Robotics Club: that was one hell of an experience.  It changed me a lot and improved my technical and soft skills.  We had BotShot and Maze-Perilous during ATMOS ‘16 - Maze-Perilous had high standards and couldn’t get high participation.  The publicity was limited too.  I attribute it to the toughness of the competition.  This time we have bomb squad and we have a good edge on publicity, and it’s basically a combination of IOT and robotics.  There’s 3-D printing involved too.

### Any message you would want to give the Freshers for their first fest?
Get out of your rooms.  Participate in the events: I think you have attended most of the pre-ATMOS events.   Along with being a lot of fun, these events and workshops are more learning-oriented.  We concentrated on teaching people and improving their technical skills.  We conducted workshops for topics like R Programming, Robotics, Coding, and Cubing.  We also have pre-ATMOS events like the Bomb Squad.  We will probably have a pre-ATMOS night – this Saturday wherein we’ll entertain and have lots of fun events.

To the Freshers, and even the seniors: **this is your fest** - your college’s technical fest.  And being in a technical college, you should be proud of it, and ready to come out of your rooms, participate and give your best for the fest.  Even if you don’t want to participate in any competition or workshop, come for the talks – when people like Dilip Chhabria or E Sreedharan are talking, what in the world are you doing in your rooms? People outside are dying for an appointment with them, and you’re in your room when they come here.  If not all this, there will be a lot of informal events, and pro-shows like The Local Train and Rahul Subramaniam’s Stand Up.
