# President- Abhinav Eittireddy
## Firstly, how are the preparations going?
We started off on a good note, had the events ready by the second week of June and the workshops confirmed by the second week of September.  The publicity went very well in the holidays: we have a great DePP team this year.  The patronages have also helped us a lot with publicity.  There was a bit of a halt last week, due to the Mid-Semester Exams and Diwali, but otherwise, the preparations have gone very efficiently.  

## In what ways do you think this ATMOS is going to be different, and better than the previous editions?
Last year, ATMOS, for us was a footfall fest, but this time we are converting it into an encouragement kind of a fest.  We have around 17 workshops- all of them are top notch in quality.  We have managed to get associated with Google Developers, Microsoft and IBM.  We have patronages from Make in India, Startup India and Digital India.
This year’s ATMOS will be the best in terms of the quality of events and prize money offered.  Even though ATMOS is clashing with many other events such as NIT Warangal’s Technozion, Sunburn, NH7 Weekender and the Pune Comedy Festival, we still are getting a good outreach.  We hope to get around 132 contingents from all across India.
The advantage of getting patronages from Make in India, Startup India and Digital India is that the students get approved certificates with Make in India and Digital India logos along with ATMOS and BITS logos.  All the events and workshops will be on par with the standards set by them.  

## Are there any aspects from the fests of previous years that you’d like to address during this ATMOS, and the entire academic year?
Compared to the previous editions of ATMOS, we’ve improved the quality and tried to improve the revenue generating sources.  
For me, this year’s edition of ATMOS is different compared to the previous ones as I am experimenting with a couple of things, like investing more and recovering the money through effective sponsorship.  Hopefully, these experiments will prove to be fruitful, so that we can improve them and implement them in the other 2 fests.
We have tried our hand at a social initiative for ATMOS this year.  We have already launched "The Blue Drop“ initiative, wherein members of Nirmaan have gone to schools for promoting water conservation.
We are introducing cashless bill payments at the food stalls this year, for on-campus students.  It’s a simple system which deducts money from the “Other Advances”.

## How has being the President changed your participation in the fest? How did you manage the workload?
It hasn't changed my view.  I always think as a general body member and then I take a decision.  I see whatever suits the general body’s interests the best and I go ahead with that.  ATMOS has been very special in my life ever since I came to campus.  

The first two years on campus, I learnt a lot about taking responsibilities and getting work done on time.  This year, it’s totally different.  I am in a position of mentorship.  I direct the juniors to work.  I delegate them the work and ask them to do it.  So, I contribute more ideas and being in a decision-making role, it gives me a lot of liberty to do new things over here.  This way the experience has been different this time.  It's is completely in your hands how you give it to the campus and the people coming to the fest.  So, it’s just shaping the fest totally from scratch.  

I didn't become President for the fest.  I believe that the President of the Student Union should work on improving the lives of students on the campus and that made me take up the responsibility.  Fests are the additional responsibilities we have, but from the next year, SU won't be involved directly in the fest.  We plan on having a fest coordinator system from next year.  A middleman who will work between the SU and student’s fest.

5.  Other than funds, how does the Administration participate in the organisation of the fest?
Whenever you want something from the management, you should have a lot of patience.  We get help from the General Administration Division with accommodation for the speakers and pro-show artists.  Every part of the fest needs the support of the management.  When a VIP is coming, there is protocol that has to be followed.  We get mementos arranged.
The administration helps us in handling the finances of the fest, not directly though.  Funds are an important aspect of the fest.  Without the funds and the approval of the administration, the fest cannot be organized at all.  We are backed by a very supportive administration which helps us run things smoothly.

## During the preparation of the fest, is there a moment that stands out? Any moment that could encapsulate the spirit of the fest? 
For me, it’s all a huge collection of memories.  I can't just pick a random one because I feel involved in every part of the fest and I have been enjoying every single bit of it.
Possibly when we confirmed the Google developer’s association, it added more value to the fest and more so to my happiness.  Whenever I receive calls from people in other cities, like the day someone from Thapar university called me and told me that he’d need this information for getting a 50-member contingent,  those are the moments which make me extremely happy.  Even after being busy with a lot of work over here, I have been going out to pitch companies and the news vendors so that we could place the ATMOS pamphlets over there to get fest publicity.  I’ve been doing all this for the past 2 years and it’s been immense fun all along the way.

## How do you handle disagreements with the FOB?
The FOB has been on the same page as me since day one, except a few times, but we were able to sort it out.  It has been quite an experience working with these amazing people.  There have been situations where we had disagreements, no denial.  But we managed to work our way around them.  I have always had their support, and they help me out in every way possible.  The members of the FOB and I have an amazing bond.

## How do you see ATMOS progressing in the future?
PEARL has a lot of recognition in Hyderabad and other parts of India, but for ATMOS we are building the brand, and ATMOS is already being recognized all over India now.  So, in the future, I see a lot of scope for activities and all kinds of revenue generation and profits.  The growth has been organic every year.  I don’t see a future where ATMOS will ever be scaled down because it is where we generate good profits.
ATMOS, on the technical side of it, will go to different heights in terms of quality and technology in Hyderabad and outside the state.  At the same time, a lot of things have to be taken care of.  One shouldn’t overshoot for no reason or get involved in things which have a lot of risks.
Even I would proudly say that ATMOS is the biggest tech fest in India solely managed by the students.  I’m in the view that ATMOS should have an organic growth.  The future of ATMOS is always secure and it is an increasing graph of progress.  You only have to experiment with various avenues and possibilities.

## In the three years that you have been a part of ATMOS, how have you grown, as a person, through the organisation of the fest?
I have always been a short tempered person but I’ve learnt to be patient over time.  This has given me an increased sense of responsibility.  As a person, it has almost been like an energy boost and an equally amazing morale boost.
Everyone I knew tried to help me in all possible ways.  That is where I realized my true potential.

## How did the outcome of the GBM affect the preparations for the Atmos?
My plan was always constant.  I did not change a single figure in it.  I did not want ATMOS to get affected by the GBMs, so I had a fixed action plan.  Come what may, my plan was for ATMOS to go unhindered.  Whatever may be the result of the GBM, I made sure that the effect on ATMOS was minimal.

## Is there any message you’d like to share with the freshers?
Now that you guys are in college, you have a lot of things to explore and you have to achieve.  It’s just that you shouldn’t lose your sense of direction.
Whenever you are working for the campus, you shouldn’t lose heart and should always be motivated.  Find some self-motivation and some goal to look forward to.
There is always a story waiting for you in the campus.  It is in your hands to go ahead and seek it.

# Technical Secretary- Sharath Golluri
## What are your expectations for the fest? Are you nervous? Excited? Talk to us about how you’re feeling now, with only a few more days to go.

TS: I’m excited! All the hard work that we have put in for the past five months comes down to this.  We are nervous, but our excitement overshadows our nervousness.  I did suffer from insomnia due to a lot of work, but now I have insomnia due to the excitement.
In my PS, I couldn’t sleep, and even when I could, I used to get nightmares.  I used to discuss in my dreams.  My roommates used to complain that I was shouting at night in my dreams.  My PS was very hectic: the days were 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM.  Phones and laptops weren’t allowed, so all communication had to be done at night, I had to stay up all night, talk to the FOB, and the heads, planning the fest.
This ATMOS will be great: 5 months of planning went into this, and our efforts will show this.  ATMOS has become a proper brand: we have patronages from Make in India, Startup India, and Digital India.  We have an association with NASSCOM 10,000 Startups for the TechExpo.

## What’s being planned for this year’s TechTainment?
TechTainment is mostly a BITS-only event where you’ll have to build or make a few projects – so far three have been planned: one is the Lightsaber from Star Wars, with an LED strip of lights to give it the glow, with the saber vibrating when it comes in contact, and a 3D printed handle.  Another project is a beat detector which will flicker with varying amounts, according to the frequency and pitch of the music playing around it.  And the third is a hologram to show visuals “The Neon Dystopia”, along with branding for the sponsors.  This is something that is not very common and will be placed in the LTC as well as G102, which is where the Techtainment projects will be displayed.  All these are simple projects, which will help participants learn under the mentorship of ARC.  If these projects are completed before ATMOS, we might even do more.

## How is it like working with such a big Fest Organizing Body? Do you feel that the team experience has added something to the fest that you alone, couldn’t?
TS: It is intense.  There are 12 departments, 14 tech senate bodies and I want everything to go through me. I strictly believe that “Too many cooks spoil the broth”, and the FOB agrees with this.
It was a great experience, I have made new and lasting friendships and my patience grew a lot as I had to wait for a long time for confirmation from companies.  It was wonderful working with a team that believed in my vision.  Our Tech Senate is very sensible, and they have a vision of how the fest can improve, and we’ve incorporated most of what they’ve suggested.
If I wanted to publicise an event, I did make a team of DePP members who would do the job for particular events.  I made this kind of a proper roadmap and FOB stood with me.
We have dedicated people in FOB who are really working hard and it all boils down to this.

## The theme for the fest is “A Neon Dystopia”.  How was this chosen to be the theme out of the many possible ideas? Is there a story behind this?
TS: We wanted to show a glimpse into the future and futuristic technology, considering both the dark and the good side of it.  The theme is a reference from Cyberpunk, a genre that focuses on a futuristic dystopia.  There are many Cyberpunk movies which we examined and found to be apt.  It was more than a month of brainstorming.  We started from the evolution: ape to human to robot.
Since I don’t watch a lot of TV shows, I had very little knowledge about this genre, and thus was rather tilted against it.  But I had to adhere to the decision of the FOB, as this is not a dictatorship, so I agreed to the theme.  However,  I didn’t expect this kind of response at all! The Campus loved it!  My only motive was to represent a futuristic world.  Most of the work on the theme was done by FOB.  They brought in the proper names., and decided on the theme.  Although I was apprehensive, initially, I was convinced after knowing more about it.  And the look of the website took away any remaining objections that I had.

## You are a Civil Engineering student, but your main interest is with Robotics.  What advice would you give to students who might want to pursue interests that are different from their branch?
TS: If you have an interest, pursue it!  But don’t neglect your academics.  They’re important and you should be able to manage both equally.  Attend your classes and in your free time, work on your interests.  The journey is hard, there’s no denying, but in due course of time, you’ll be seeing the results which will keep you going.  There are many robotics enthusiasts here including 2nd years who’ll help you if you don’t hesitate and approach them for guidance.
I haven’t taken up even a single project this semester due to my commitment for ATMOS.  I’ll probably get back after ATMOS.
As far as Robotics is concerned, from my personal side, I feel that the Robotics and even Coding Culture in the Campus has to grow a lot.  We will have an inter-BITS coding competition.  We had a pre-ATMOS Mozilla Hackathon as well.

## After having been involved in ATMOS for three years, in varying degrees of participation, how do you feel ATMOS has changed you? How much has the fest come to mean to you?
A lot.  It means a lot for me.  I entered this college as a Narayana-Chaitanya product.  I always had a dream to do something related to robotics.  That was my driving motivation in class 12 to study for competitive exams.  Finally, I came here – my score was not very high, so I had to take Civil Engineering: I didn’t know about the Dual Degrees.  Like every other first-year, I dreamt for a verti, then ATMOS happened.  
Our pre-ATMOS events were AMAZING! We had a quadcopter challenge in which Surya Teja Cheedella (who was a GSoCian and Texas Instruments intern) was our mentor.  One morning, we went to test the Quadcopter.  We lost signal from the Quadcopter in the middle due to low battery.  The quadcopter kept on flying and didn’t stop.  We ran behind the quadcopter, trying everything we could, but it kept on flying and went into the jungle-ish area that used to be behind Krishna Bhavan.  We tried going in and searching, but there were a lot of crabs and other stuff, and we couldn’t find it.  Then we thought we should’ve built a Quadcopter with a GPS tracker, and repented.  Now we’re building an autonomous Quadcopter that’ll fly on its own - it’s a long-term project that will probably be ready in a year or so
During ATMOS ‘16, I was one of the executive body members of the Automation and Robotics Club: that was one hell of an experience.  It changed me a lot and improved my technical and soft skills.  We had BotShot and Maze-Perilous during ATMOS ‘16 - Maze-Perilous had high standards and couldn’t get high participation.  The publicity was limited too.  I attribute it to the toughness of the competition.  This time we have bomb squad and we have a good edge on publicity, and it’s basically a combination of IOT and robotics.  There’s 3-D printing involved too.

## Any message you would want to give the Freshers for their first fest?
Get out of your rooms.  Participate in the events: I think you have attended most of the pre-ATMOS events.   Along with being a lot of fun, these events and workshops are more learning-oriented.  We concentrated on teaching people and improving their technical skills.  We conducted workshops for topics like R Programming, Robotics, Coding, and Cubing.  We also have pre-ATMOS events like the Bomb Squad.  We will probably have a pre-ATMOS night – this Saturday wherein we’ll entertain and have lots of fun events.
To the Freshers, and even the seniors: this is your fest - your college’s technical fest.  And being in a technical college, you should be proud of it, and ready to come out of your rooms, participate and give your best for the fest.  Even if you don’t want to participate in any competition or workshop, come for the talks – when people like Dilip Chhabria or E Sreedharan are talking, what in the world are you doing in your rooms? People outside are dying for an appointment with them, and you’re in your room when they come here.  If not all this, there will be a lot of informal events, and pro-shows like The Local Train and Rahul Subramaniam’s Stand Up.
