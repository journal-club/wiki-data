# Freshmen Reviews: 2017 Batch’s Opinions Matter Too! 
(Maybe... At least a little.)

**Poornima Venkatapuram**: ATMOS 2017 was a blast! It was an invigorating breath of fresh air after a not so..er..merry mid-sems. Cashless ATMOS was a huge savior. [GG, Cashless Team.] It’d have been a lot more better if we were given a schedule of all the events happening everywhere but on a whole, +1 for ATMOS 2018.

**Pranav Sista**: ATMOS 2017 is going to stay in our hearts for a long time. And credit should be given where credit is due. The amazing footfall brought by DePP, the phenomenal pieces of art by Arts & Deco, the foot-tapping concerts and stomach clutching comedy events by DoPE, the sound of tinkering cash by DoSM and everyone else that made it possible; you are the pride of BPHC. However, there is a dire necessity of increase in quality of the workshops happening.

**Vedika Kulkarni**: FOOOOOOD!!! The food trucks brought to the event were amazing! While there’s no necessity, I feel an obligation to mention the amazing pro-shows that happened. I don’t know which was better; waving hands with my friends as the rhythm of Choo Lo coursed through or the feel of being hilariously flustered as Rahul Subramaniam was roasting us. I felt surges of annoyance when I saw the overlapping of several events, though.

**Siddarth Sampath**: Hearing the talks by the Metro Man, Dilip Chhabria and A.S. Kiran Kumar made me realize the perks I had of being a BITSian. It was an honour to be a part of their audience. The Rahul Subramanian show was an excellent way of relaxing ourselves after having experienced 3 days of exquisite technical extravaganza and the fact that he did his research on the ‘issues’ of the campus was… umm.. surprising initially,  but it was an excellent way to laugh at ourselves and accept the fact that we (or some of us) did get swayed emotionally and logic lost the relevance it deserved. [RIP DOG WARS.]

**Sarthak Das**: This year, ATMOS was taken to heights never reached before. Increased footfall and never ending enthusiasm of the participants made this year's one the best. Ample food stalls had been put up and offered lots of choices for those who just wanted to sit, eat and have fun. It would have been better if the events had started on time. (IST, not BST) 
 
# A Veteran’s ("the seniors") Musings

**Kushagra K Chanda** : If I had to characterize this Atmos in one word, it would be efficiency. Events started with almost no delay, the inaug was short and sweet, and all problems were handled immediately. The FOB has done an amazing job, and the bar has certainly been set very high for all future editions of ATMOS.

**Rohitt Vashishtha** : As a BITSian, it is our moral obligation to delay events so we get a bigger audience while working at our own smooth pace. We lacked something important this time. We lacked BST. The punctuality of the events this ATMOS offends me to the core. You know how many people lost their chance to attend events this year because there was no BST? Sacrilegious! Where is your BITSian pride?! In case you didn’t get my sarcasm, I’d like to take this opportunity to compliment the extremely efficient and punctual functioning of things this ATMOS while subtly managing the difficulties caused by the higher footfall.
