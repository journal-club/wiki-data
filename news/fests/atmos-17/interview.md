# General secretary-Aditya Iyer
## What are your views on ATMOS 2017? In what ways was this ATMOS different from previous ones?
Well, it was a very overwhelming experience for us, as the Students’ Union Council and as the FOB.
It’s always very new and exciting to organize the first fest of the semester, because it’s the first time that we worked together as leading 3rd yearites, and not as executive 2nd yearites or 1st yearites, in all the Departments, Clubs and Associations.

After all the efforts that have been put in, the response to ATMOS ’17 was really overwhelming, because this time we have surpassed previous ATMOS’ in terms of footfall. We had more 4000 to 5000 off-campus registrations, which was quite larger than before, so kudos to DePP for that.
We had two very good pro-shows and amazing talks, from eminent personalities. Our workshops were much better curated this time as well. We had 17 quality workshops and turnout was so huge that we had to close registrations for a lot of them. So in this vein, I guess we had a great ATMOS, probably the best yet, at least in terms of participation.

Yes, there are a few things we could have done better, and we are going to have a fest review meet with the FOB, and any General Body members that wish to attend, soon. We will try to pinpoint our strengths and weaknesses so that coming fests keep improving.

## Talk us through how the post of General Secretary changed your contribution to ATMOS. What were some of the responsibilities that you didn’t have last time?
Let’s go with a comparison. So, last year I was a 2nd yearite and the role of a 2nd yearite is a crucial one because you are no longer a 1st yearite who needs to be told, step-by-step, exactly what to do. And you’re also not making decisions yet. In 2nd year, you’re somewhere in between, where your main job is, along with your batchmates and juniors, to execute the plan and vision that the 3rd yearites have, asking for their help and guidance where needed.

Of course, the guidance still remains, we do look up to our seniors for advice, but the role has definitely changed. This time, as a part of the FOB, it is our job to make the plans that our juniors will then execute.

As the General Secretary, I was mainly dealing with the Administration. It was new for me, but there needed to be someone who could handle things from the Administration side, take all permissions and get approvals for whatever plans we had.

Other than that, getting the ATMOS merchandise, working with the Departments, and the President and Technical Convenor throughout the fest, were my responsibilities.
Further, the three of us, and the entire SUC were involved in planning from the start. It was May, I guess when the conference calls started, for ATMOS. The main difference, I think, is the level of our involvement in influencing the direction of the fest and its plans.

## This year cashless ATMOS was introduced. How the experience? How was the response? Were there any difficulties or things that could have been better?
The response was again, very overwhelming, we had a turnover of around Rs 3 Lakhs at the food stalls itself. That was really a big turnover against previous ATMOS. We always had revenue of around 1.5 Lakhs or at most 2 Lakhs and this year’s revenue was really much greater than them. At the first day itself, so many coupons were exchanged that we were wondering that we might run out of coupons. This was due to the success of cashless ATMOS. People really appreciated the freedom given by cashless ATMOS to spend on food stalls as it is once in awhile that you eat outside food.

There were some technical issues with starting and closing the stalls, we also had some issues with people registering on SWD portal for cashless ATMOS. We had a lot of technical issues related with that throughout the fest, but we are better equipped now. We have learned from our difficulties and next time wherever we apply cashless service, it will be much smoother.

## After the massive success of ATMOS ‘17, we are looking forward to Pearl and Arena. What SUC has in store for us there?
For both Arena and Pearl, we have already started planning. We have already had Arena FOB meets, and for Pearl, it’s going to happen very soon by end of this weekend.
This Arena is inter-BITS this time; the other three campuses will be visiting us this year. We have some special things lined up for Arena, especially for the inauguration.
As far as Pearl is concerned, we have a lot of special plans and we have also finalized the theme which is a surprise for the general body. We hope to release it before the compres and we are planning to focus more on regionals this year like we implemented in ATMOS, and also on the Campus Ambassador program. Campus Ambassador program was a very successful investment: we invest in 100 to 200 people and they give returns of about 50 to 60 each, which I think is a great yield. There is also a special focus on headliners and many other things. Once we have the Pearl FOB meet, we’ll have better clarity with respect to the fest.

## Is there any message you would like to send to freshers and to future SUC after you?
My only message is, in fact, an open view shared by the whole SUC that 2nd yearites need to be much more involved in the fest than they currently are. We do appreciate their work; we know it’s a change from doing things exactly as said to implement them on their own. But they need to take a step up in responsibilities that you are taking up in the fest. Not only in the fest, but in every aspect of college life. Because unless you take that step up and start doing things on your own, you won’t be in a position to plan effectively in your 3rd year. At the same time, you’ve got to start understanding your juniors and learn how to delegate work.

Coming to the 1st yearites, I am very to happy see their enthusiasm throughout the semester after everything that happened in starting. Despite the lack of connection between seniors and freshers, there has been an enthusiastic response from first yearites in willingness to do things, which is appreciable.

My message, not just to 2nd yearites, or freshers, would be: Start taking more responsibilities in the fest because it’s not only the SUC or FOB which is doing the fest but all of us. Even if you are doing the work of transporting things or be the managing the public at pro shows, your support and efforts are valuable and they count towards the success of the fest.
