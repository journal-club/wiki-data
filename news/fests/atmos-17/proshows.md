# Proshows!
You know that ATMOS has arrived when you can feel that feverish excitement in the air. ATMOS is three complete days filled with the perfect blend of lore and enthusiasm. The days were packed with competitions and workshops, while the nights were raw entertainment. This coupled with the decorations gave the campus an air of festivity unlike any other.

The most awaited events in any fest are the pro shows. The very first pro show of ATMOS was the performance by The Local Train on the 28th of October. The band swayed the crowds and stole their hearts with their original Indian rock songs. The campus would not be able to forget them ever again after that breath-taking performance.

The second pro show of techno-management fest was the stand-up comedy performance by Rahul Subramaniam which was opened by our very own Sateja  Paradkar on the 29th of October. The performance was basically Rahul Subramaniamâ€™s comedic take on the events on campus, be it the low cut-offs or the dogs. Not to mention the hilarious story of his lazy maid and how she controls his entire life which drove the crowd insane. The performance cheered up everyone and no one could have asked for a more fitting ending for an amazing fest.
