# Talk by A S Kiran Kumar
Padma Shri A. S. Kiran Kumar, credited with the development of key scientific instruments aboard the Chandrayaan-1 and Mangalyaan space crafts, held a tele-presence talk on the 2nd day of ATMOSâ€™17. He spoke at length about the humble beginnings of ISRO, and the pivotal role of Vikram Sarabhai in building ISRO from scratch. Emphasizing the importance of space technology in the modern day, he gave examples of how meteorological data from satellites saves thousands of lives predicting cyclones, and how the concept of geomorphological studies could be given to the country by space technology. The ISRO chairman also gave his views on the Mangalyaan mission and pointed out the efficiency of the people working at ISRO, saying it was an example of the maximum output being achieved when the resources are constrained, given, one should always challenge limits. When asked on the biggest challenge faced during the Mangalyaan mission, he explained how the force sunlight (which consists of photons) falling on the space vehicle was enough to change the trajectory of the space vehicle and that they went ahead with the project even though there was a considerable chance of losing it forever.
