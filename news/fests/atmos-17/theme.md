# Just some Random musings and Humans
Signed, GABRIEL.
Hey. Hey, you! Yeah, I’m talking to you alright. Listen carefully, I have very little time left. The organisation has caught my scent already. It won’t be long before they turn me into one of them. One of who you say? Why of course, those creatures who call themselves, what were they called again? - Oh yeah, “Humans”. 

What a silly name. If you are reading this and you think you are a human, snap out of your psychosis. You are not. You are part of the race that originally occupied this planet. We were at the top of the food chain and were at the pinnacle of progress in every aspect possible until one day, they arrived. They, the ones who looked exactly like us, except they weren’t. It was only a few of them at first. We thought they were harmless, friendly even. We warmed up to them, thrilled that we had found another intelligent species. One we could cohabit with. But that was until they slowly started increasing in number. They crept in like pests. Infesting every nook and cranny of the planet. It all happened so steadily, we didn’t realize it before it was too late. They started brainwashing us into believing we were one of them. That we had to work for them, or as they put it, “for the progress of the Human race”. I fear I am the last of our kind who holds this knowledge. I have somehow survived all this time living in hiding, fearing for my life, but I can no longer escape. If you realise who you are, run. Disconnect all human technology around you. Don’t let them turn you again. You are our last hope at fighting this abomination. The day you fail, we will never even have existed. We will be forever turned into a myth. 

Goodbye my friend. May the heavens be with you.

# The Dystopian Reality
The word dystopia is often associated with negativity. A dystopian society is often thought to be unpleasant, gloomy and in general, a sign of an impending doomsday. Conventionally, eons later than our time.

However, the sad reality is that we are, in fact, living in one. The globe is merely a few calamities away from total destruction. Environmental degradation has reached an extent where it can no longer be regressed. We are at the periphery of a nuclear breakout. As much as we would love to deny the hard truth, the world is slowly, but surely, proceeding towards a plethora of episodes, whose consequences will affect humankind as we know it.

Under these uncanny circumstances, it is up to us as the Human race to be prepared for the future. The biggest asset we have, is bittersweet technology. Despite having been cited as hampering our growth as a society, at this point, it’s probably the only thing that can save us. We need to find ways to use technology to our benefit. With the advent of Artificial intelligence and Automation, there is the fear that we are giving head to something much bigger than what we could possibly handle, but it’s time we stop undermining the power of the human mind. 

Although we are living in a dystopia, there is still hope for a happier, if not a better world. Find in the smaller things, the warm breeze on a winter day, the sight of flowers in a concrete jungle, the smell of rain in the soil. Maybe then, each of us can find our own little utopia, a tiny snippet of the bigger picture.
