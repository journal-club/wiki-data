# Department of Visual Effects (DoVE)
The members of the Department of Visual Effects worked day and night to shoot and edit the footage of every event that was happening all around the campus during ATMOS.

They also got to learn new techniques of shooting and an experience in editing. With all the amazing shots captured and the technical prowess of their members, the aftermovie is expected to be top-notch.

# Department of Security and Hospitality (DoSH)
This ATMOS, DoSH efficiently managed the ever-increasing footfall without faltering at any moment. Even though DoSH is a huge department, everyone knew their jobs and completed all its duties with a skillful task force comprising of experienced seniors and enthusiastic juniors.

They ensured that every event gets their lights and sounds requirements so that the events run smoothly. They worked tediously to ensure that the lights and sound production of the pro-shows were up to the mark. The DJ Nite conducted by them during the fest made ATMOS more festive.

# Department of Recreational Activities (DoRA) 
DoRA, the Department of Recreational Activities, oversaw the provision of leisure activities which acted as huge stress-busters and rejuvenated the body in between the hectic schedule of ATMOS.
