<!-- TITLE: On Fake News and the Mob -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: An editorial by Niharika Shankar on Mob Justice. -->

A man, a cat and an angry mob walk into a bar. The cat doesn’t order anything - cats are always drunk anyway. It posts a selfie on the internet and curls up on the bar to nap. The angry mob orders one large ‘Bowling Green’.

“Umm…I’m afraid there’s no such thing,” stammers the wretched bartender.

The mob is in frustrated unison. There’s too many people. To make things worse, it seems as if only one wit is distributed evenly, which leads to very little wit around each. 

It is too late for our man. He is lynched by the angry mob. They reason he is hiding a bottle of the famed BowlingGreen. The cat naps on.

This is how ‘deindividuation’<sup>1</sup> works.

This is not very different from the mob lynchings that happened since May.  It all started with a WhatsApp forward. Small. Unlike your generic "benefits-of-organic-pesticides" messages or "101-reasons-why-India-is-the-most-cultural-country" forwards that relative seem to love forwarding nowadays, these messages warned of roaming child traffickers and organ harvesters. The problem was, these serious allegations came without a shred of proof and were probably fake.  Fake allegations of serious crime that affected innocent people.

Take for instance, Shanta Devi - a forty year old woman in Ahmedabad. She was killed on 26th June by an angry mob because they suspected she was a child kidnapper. On 1st July, villagers in Maharashtra lynched five people on the same suspicion. On 9th May, a sixty-five year old woman called Rukmani was murdered by a mob in Tamil Nadu, mistaken for a child trafficker. <sup>2</sup>

We can’t help being deindividuated in large crowds. It can happen to anyone, and it probably has evolutionary advantages. Crowds can get things done. But when fairy fiction begins to whisper in the ear of the mob, we can have horrific red blood on our hands like we do today.

Twenty innocent people have been murdered in separate incidents across the country. Even in major 'developed' cities like Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. Murdered in cold bood by angry crowds.

To put this in perspective, here is a Wikipedia excerpt<sup>3</sup>  describing the lynching of an American man in 1916 -  “The spectacle lynching drew a large crowd estimated at 10,000, including the…chief of police…As the lynching occurred at midday, children from local schools walked down (to observe) …Many parents approved of their children's attendance, hoping that the lynching would reinforce a belief in white supremacy.”

That killing was fuelled by racial bias, which might explain why so many people let it happen.  

Here in 2018, the twenty lynchings were fueled…by rumors. By false information. Fake news, spreading unbridled across WhatsApp.

*Unbridled* is a strange word, isn’t it? News must be, in purity, unbridled in its source and spread. Otherwise, we have situations like Russia<sup>4</sup>, China<sup>5</sup>… and *whisper* even India<sup>6</sup>. Countries where media and journalism are freely manipulated to paint the desired narrative of the government. [Countries were news can be bought, for a price](/news/oped/operation-136-cobrapost-press). In other words, where there is no freedom of press, there is propaganda.

Yet, unbridled people can shamelessly concoct stories out of thin air, spitefully spread cleverly designed narratives to bring harm to other people. We saw exactly that in the past few days.

Everyone has the ability to lie. Both the state and the common people. To end this write-up with airy suggestions of ‘journalistic ethics’ and ‘moral obligation to tell the truth’ would be mighty convenient, wouldn’t it? But it isn’t convenient to look at pictures of a human being dismembered and burnt by hordes of other human beings. It isn’t convenient to be branded as a ‘child abductor’ and beaten to death in the middle of a street. It isn’t convenient to be lied to.

So, let us live with that inconvenience for a while. The inconvenience of knowing we live in a world where bad things happen. A world where truth is rarer than a Unicorn. A world where facts have the same meaning as opinions and opinions have the same place as facts.
