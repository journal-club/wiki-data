Ah, women! What would we do without them? The nurturing wombs of life, the welcoming lovers, the butt of campus gender ratio jokes and the butts in TOI newspapers. They do it all, pun you wish were intended. 2017 was the year of the Woman. With the #MeToo and the Women’s March in the US, the ladies took up a fair share of public limelight to whine about their problems. And gosh, whine they did! According to CBS news, 1.7 million tweets of MeToo spread across 85 countries. 

Back home in India though, Asifa happens to be the top trending word in porn and marital rape is considered to be perfectly legitimate, justified even. According to the HRD Ministry, in 2017, there has been a 50% increase in reported cases on sexual harassment from various higher education institutions across the country. 149 cases of sexual harassment were reported from universities and 39 cases from colleges and other institutions in 2017.

These are just the reported cases. An overwhelming majority of such crimes remain silently borne. The immense cultural conditioning and iron-strong patriarchy ensures that most women accept the injustice as a ‘normal’ part of life. The story is shared in closed rooms, with the closest of friends, with a macabre, closed laugh. “Yes, something like this happened to me too…”, they say. Very few go on record, keeping the system safe and secure, allowing it to perpetrate for generations.  

To be clear, sexual crimes are inherently gender-blind. Rape, sexual harassment and domestic violence can happen to all genders. Which is why the fact that the overwhelming majority of the victims of these crimes are female - is deeply troubling. The female sex may not be called ‘second’ anymore, but it is still seen, heard and treated so. 

Fortunately, we are in a privileged place. We are students of Science and Engineering, we train to think rationally and objectively. We stand shoulder to shoulder in noble brotherhood. We certainly do not need any lectures on gender equality, sexual harassment and women’s rights! We are Woke, thank you very much.

Yet, the University Grants Commission of India mandated an ‘Internal Complaints Committee’ specifically for tackling sexual harassment of people just like you and me. BPHC has its own - complete and running. The ICC was set up just last year. We have student representatives, Teaching and Non-teaching staff members, as well as an outsider in the committee. Whilst we must celebrate its existence, we ought to also question its requirement in the first place. Imagine having a special committee across universities to deal specifically with say... mugging. It would be ridiculous and disturbing at the same time. You certainly can’t picture your professor or the lab assistant holding you at gunpoint and snatching your wallet. 

But being sexually harassed carries a very different flavor for the victim: more shame than indignance, more guilt than anger. That’s why saying “me too” was so powerful. Saying “Me Too” does not simply mean you tell someone you went through derogation too. Saying “Me Too” means you acknowledge the legitimacy of someone else’s experience of derogation, which is rare for women to get. For example, Kevin Spacey’s male accusers were certainly not asked what they were wearing at that time neither were they accused of ‘attention seeking’. For women, the movement was not about realizing the extent of the issue, they already knew. It was about validating their decades-suppressed anger.

Even Joanne Kathleen Rowling had to suppress her own name because her publishers doubted her sex would prevent the world from meeting Harry. No matter how woke we are, we live suppressed and fearful of the glass ceiling. The famed glass ceiling: it’s transparent, invisible. It’s made out of co-ed schools where teachers tell boys in secret to not be ‘distracted by the girls’. It’s made out of department meetings held in the boys’ hostel basements after 2.00 am. It’s made out of feeble biological ‘facts’ about ‘hormones’ and ‘female dispositions’. It’s made out of our gender ratio. It’s made out of the abrupt knocking in the middle of the night if you don’t give your biometric attendance before Intime. It starts out thin, then grows tall with you. 

These ‘lite’ things work in sync, all together to form a menacing monster called Patriarchy- the ‘get of jail free’ card that the perpetrators always seem to have. Patriarchy puts pressure on our systems and makes life tougher in the long run for everybody, regardless of gender. Freedom and creativity remain stifled in the pursuit of impossible gender expectations. Nevertheless, we have come a long way. In 1818, Western Christian missionaries started the first schools in India open to girls. In 1876, Calcutta University first allowed women to attend only the exams. In 1879, Bethune college became the first college to allow women. And here we all are are today at BPHC, both men and women, in 2018, all because of the centuries old feminist struggle to break the status quo.  While Merriam Webster’s Word of the Year was ‘Feminism’, Oxford gave that title to ‘Youthquake.’ That makes us all a part of breaking the present status quo of macabre silence. Me too. You too.
