<!-- TITLE: Operation 136: Press for Sale to the Highest Bidder  -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: An opinion editorial by XYZ on the Cobrapost Expose and what it means for us. -->

It was close to two months ago, on March 26th, when Cobrapost reported that the largest media houses in India were allegedly ready to accept huge amounts of money to promote the ideology of Hindutva and malign political opponents through character assassination and caricaturing. If this is true, it shows the type blatant opportunists that may be heading some of the biggest organisations masquerading as media houses in India. The expose was titled Operation 136 (symbolic of India's rank of 136 in World Press Freedom Index 2017). <sup>1</sup>

These operations were carried out by investigative journalist Pushp Sharma, who went undercover as Acharya Atal, a person who had connections with RSS and wanted to promote Bhagavad Gita. In the sting operations, Atal is seen outlining a **three-phase plan** on how these houses could promote Hindutva and support a political party, in exchange for amounts ranging from a few crore to Rs. 500 crore.

  - Phase 1 of the campaign would involve ‘soft Hindutva’ where the organisation would promote Lord Krishna and Bhagawad Gita in order to propagate "hindutva vibes".
  - Phase 2 would involve content targeting Opposition leaders “Pappu, Bua and Babua” (Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav) via jingles and caricatures.
  - Phase 3 would depend on whatever is required in the months that lead up to the 2019 general elections approach in the later part of the year.

The sting operation videos released by Cobrapost (link to [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtIitJsHQm64R3FYDlyEqoMB3ZJQUzQ8C)) show media executives of companies such as Scoop Whoop, DNA India, Rediff.com and India TV as well as dozens of other media companies, nodding to these ideas, devising ways to carry this out and sometimes even taking notes. 

Cobrapost has stung again recently, on May 25th, when it released Operation 136 II ([link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtIitJsHQm66Z2Vk7Us-YE_Bhy0_eYG_C)). This time it has managed to get the big guns of this dirty business on camera. The second part of Operation Cobra featured Vineet Jain, MD of the Times Group that controls Times Now, Mirror Now and The Times of India, among others. 

The head of the largest media conglomerate in India (Financial Times, 2015) is seen on the sting-tape giving tips to 'Atal Sharma' on how to go through with the payment, asking him to give the cash to companies such as the Adani Group who can then give him a cheque. He is seen insisting on a cheque-based transaction as 'the group has no use for cash', all the while accepting to release content that fits the requirements, as long as it was ‘within limits’.

Their response to all these allegations? The Bennett Coleman Group, the company that owns ToI, put out a statement saying Vineet Jain and his associates indulged Atal Sharma and carried out a 'reverse sting' to expose him, and that they were planning to find out who was behind him. <sup>2</sup>

Also caught on tape was Vice-President of PayTM, Ajay Sekhar Sharma who was saying that the PMO had asked for the personal data of some users in J&K after stone pelting incidents in Kashmir. He is also seen admitting his relations with the BJP and RSS. PayTM eventually put out a statement saying it shares data with legally compliant requests only. He is not, however, seen on tape mentioning whether the data was provided to the PMO or not.



Other media agencies featuring in the tapes include the Dainik Bhaskar, Radio One, BigFM and nearly 27 others were also seen to be receptive to these ideas. Dainik Sambad and Bartaman were the only newspapers that didn't succumb to this. 

Even though the tapes might not be completely true, the fact that half the news organisations there haven’t released a statement explaining their side of the story, or rejecting these allegations in itself is another worrisome symptom.

The fact that some media houses may suck up to the Centre is in itself appalling. What's even more appalling ‌is the fact that none of the other media houses covered this expose. While it may be blamed on management, who might be preventing such articles, journalists too, are complicit to this to some extent as they haven’t spoken up to this. 

Some journalists have tried to release clarifications - Rajdeep Sardesai, for example, tweeted saying that India Today never silenced him when he was taking up a story. However, other users raised concerns on whether he was being allowed to speak freely only because he never took up controversial issues.
 

While we shouldn’t be singling Rajdeep Sardesai out, there's a bigger threat that has to be recognized - that the very media that can bring about enormous change and impact to our society is up for sale to the highest bidder.

If they begin to fall under the influence of money, it's up to us, the citizens, to ensure we're not played by the system. It is, there'wave’fore, of the essence, that we are politically aware and mature enough not to be swayed by a media that can be bought.
