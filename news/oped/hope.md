Problems. We all have them. Be it your grades, the untouched pile of laundry in your room or your annoying wing-mate. One thing we all know for a fact is that the only way to deal with them is by addressing them. We all love to discuss our ever-dropping CG and about how there are no more clothes in the closet, why is it then that talking about mental health is such a taboo?



We are all at an age where we are both socially and biologically, most susceptible to psychological stress. Statistically speaking, around 75 percent of mental illnesses begin before the age of 24. We reside in a campus filled with individuals who are just as vulnerable to the situations we face as any other. Then why is it that no one steps up and talks about the psychological difficulties that come with the amount of work that we deal with on a regular basis? Is it that all of the 3,500 odd students coming from highly varying walks of life have mastered the art of perfectly dealing with all of their academic and personal troubles? Or are we just busy building a façade of perfection?

Health is wealth, stay fit. This has been emphasized very frequently, by adults to us, as we grew up. How is it that nobody lectures you on being mentally fit then? We are part of one of the most progressive universities in the country. We need to create an environment conducive to talks about something as serious as mental health. Even more so, considering the recent events. We, as a community, need to learn to be more accepting of each other’s issues if we want to progress further. Disillusioning ourselves into believing that everybody is perfectly capable of handling their lives without any hiccups in the grey stuff will get us nowhere.

Mental illness is the most prominent cause of suicide, which is the second leading cause of death among youth aged between 15 and 24. A simple Google search will show you more than 40,000 stories from the past 5 years, of students who decided to end their lives thinking that it was the best way to escape their troubles. We need to be more understanding and sensitive to other’s difficulties, especially when it comes to emotional and mental issues. 

We have had enough. Enough of shying away from difficulties. Enough of building and believing in fake personas. Enough of living a farce. We live in a world where we would all rather deal with someone’s bad internet over their bad mental health. It’s time for us to bring back the human touch that has been lacking this entire time.

Mental illness has many forms: depression, anxiety and stress to name a few. If you think you have a problem, or someone you know who may have one, look for help immediately. Go to the campus therapist or talk to someone who you think will be able to help you with it. If you think someone is mentally unstable or ill, take them to a doctor immediately. Most suicides and deaths related to such causes can be prevented by getting them proper help in time. Mental illness is not a stigma and the sooner we deal with it, the better it will be. 

It’s never too late to lend a hand to those in troubled circumstances. Let us all try to be more understanding and empathetic of each other. We’re here for 4 long years after all. Let us try to make this place truly a home away from home and help people find a family, away from family.
