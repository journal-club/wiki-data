# The Backstory
More than two months of protests, discussions with the administration and plenty of angry Facebook posts culminated in a coordinated protest by BITSians in various locations in India. In the first week of July, BITSians in Mumbai attempted to protest outside KMB’s office in Worli, Mumbai. While they initially discovered that the police had banned all protests there for two weeks in that area (perhaps for reasons unrelated to our protests), they petitioned the police to allow the protest, and ultimately sent a written request to the office of Shri K M Birla. The Hon’ble Chancellor agreed to meet the student representatives and the date of the meeting was finalised to ______. 

After the meet, the student representatives claimed that they spent a very productive few hours in the office of KMB and discussed a lot of things related to the protests. A post by Siddhartha Namburi (one of the most visible faces of the protest) on the Facebook group BITSians for Each Other said that the session was very productive and that there would be an official announcement on that the next day. 

The next day came. Nothing happened. No announcement. Another day passed. No news. By the third day, people were wondering what had happened. What happened to the announcement that was promised? Did something go wrong?

Finally, ____ days after the protest, a Facebook post was put on BITSians for Each Other that described the results of the meet with the chancellor.
