# The Backstory
More than two months of protests, discussions with the administration and plenty of angry Facebook posts culminated in a coordinated protest by BITSians in various locations in India. In the first week of July, BITSians in Mumbai attempted to protest outside KMB’s office in Worli, Mumbai. While they initially discovered that the police had banned all protests there for two weeks in that area (perhaps for reasons unrelated to our protests), they petitioned the police to allow the protest, and ultimately sent a written request to the office of Shri K M Birla. The Hon’ble Chancellor agreed to meet the student representatives and the date of the meeting was finalised to ______. 

After the meet, the student representatives claimed that they spent a very productive few hours in the office of KMB and discussed a lot of things related to the protests. A post by Siddhartha Namburi (one of the most visible faces of the protest) on the Facebook group BITSians for Each Other said that the session was very productive and that there would be an official announcement on that the next day. 

The next day came. Nothing happened. No announcement. Another day passed. No news. By the third day, people were wondering what had happened. What happened to the announcement that was promised? Did something go wrong?

Finally, ____ days after the protest, a Facebook post was put on BITSians for Each Other that described the results of the meet with the chancellor.

# The Deal
## Fee Hike Not Rolled Back

Some people celebrated and rejoiced at the wake of the meeting with KMB, while others exhibited more caution. While the fact that the Chancellor himself agreed to the meet and discussed the problems is a reassuring move there exists a need to examine the detail in more detail to see what’s happening. The first thing that's clearly seen in the deal is that the fee hike for this year hadn't been rolled back - all of us will have to pay the announced fee [point #2].

A major problem with the deal is that a large number of the “agreements” are pretty.ambiguous and vague. Also, the initial aim of the protest, rolling back the fee hike isn't happening either and most of the points on the deal are perhaps more about damage control rather than addressing the elephant in the room: that BITS fees are getting insanely high and even modest (5-6% YoY) increases can compound to an insanely high amount in the near future.

## “One Batch, One Fee”

One of the major agreements in the deal [point #1] is that the institute will release the total cost of education (for 4/5 years in college) during the time of admission itself. Also, existing batches would know how much more they'd have to pay for the rest of their time in BITS by the end of July. While this was dubbed as “One Batch, One Fee” (OBOF), the name is slightly misleading as OBOF is commonly understood (in NITs) as the tuition fee in first year being the same as the tuition fee in the last year of college. Here, however, the fee for each year will be **different** (and increasing over the years), but clearly announced. 

On the bright side, this will ensure that educational loans for future batches will cover the entire educational period, without getting exhausted midway. However, planning the finances of the institute for the next five years (which is what the institute will have to do for this to be implemented) is no mean feat. It is therefore possible, that the fee hike every year may be slightly larger to account for any unexpected contingencies that can occur two or three years down the line. Ultimately, we may end up having to pay more than year-on-year fee hikes. Also, future batches joining the institute will have to agree to the four year fees before joining - which might dissuade aspirants from joining. (Many of us joining BITS did not really expect consecutive fee hikes this large. Aspirants assume fee hikes would be a once-in-a-while-thing). Also, the future batches would lose bargaining power over the fees to be paid, as they would've known and agreed to the fees before joining.

The student community was assured that the institute is reviewing the fee structure for currently enrolled batches and that we'd know “*the exact amount to be paid for the complete remaining duration of the enrolment of the current batches by the end of July.*” This is in a way towards the transparent administration we tried to achieve.
