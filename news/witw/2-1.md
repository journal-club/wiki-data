<!-- TITLE: Whispers in the Woods 2.1 -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: WITW 2.1 was the freshman edition of Whispers in the Woods, published by Journal Club in August 2018. -->

**Whispers in the Wood 2.1** is one of our biggest initiatives - 1100+ printed copies of this magazine were distributed to the incoming 2018 batch at Hyderabad. The magazine also includes a 20+ page magazine with information about all the clubs, departments, associations, and official bodies on campus - essentially serving as a "mini-orientation" titled as the *Organisations Manual*. With multiple web-pages on this wiki complimenting the magazine, WITW2.1 presented information in a well-designed, easy-to-read format. 

**Whispers in the Woods 2.1 (2018)** was published in association with **[State Bank of India, Jawahar Nagar Branch](http://sbi.bank)** and **Sakthi's Kitchen Private Ltd.**
