## How do you think our team will fare at the Mega-ATV competition?
I think the team will do really well. We’re more than halfway through and only the suspension is left to be completed.We’ll finish the ATV inthe next five days, test itin the following 3 days and then we’ll kick ass at the competition,which is on the 24-26th February, 2018. This is only the 3rd edition of the Mega ATV competition, so not all the teams that participate in Baja participate in this competition. So I think our chances are pretty good.

## What is the total cost of building an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV)? How do you raise money for building the ATV?

If you build one from scratch, it’ll cost you
approximately ₹6 lakhs. Last year, we already
had the engine, the gearbox and a
few other parts, so it cost us approximately
₹4 lakhs. We shelled out ₹30,000 per person
and we managed to make do. However,
this time we had to buy new components
again. We’re working on finding
sponsorship. Also, the SU sanctioned
₹40,000 for us, but we’re still waiting for
that money to come through
