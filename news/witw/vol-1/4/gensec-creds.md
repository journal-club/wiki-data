**What clubs and Departments have you worked in so far?**
I've worked in five clubs and six departments. I was the Joint Secretary of Designers Anonymous(Da), a core committee member of Journal Club in my 1-2, and am a member of VFx Club, Photog, and Shades. Coming to the departments, I'm a part of DoTA, DePP, Firewallz, Controlz, DoVE, and Departments of Arts and Deco.

**What kind of leadership experience do you have?**
I was the Verba Maximus Design Head for VM '18 and I'm was also the Joint-Sec of Da. I managed to pull off five effective workshops and teach 23 new designers how to design. I can proudly say that Designers' Anonymous was one of the few clubs that conducted workshops to induct people. And as VM Design Head, during inductions, a lot of people approached me to learn to design. So I made sure that no one in my team actually knew designing before hand, and I  taught people before getting stuff out of them. You can see the results on the VM page.

**What is your vision, briefly, not just during the nine days of the fest, but the whole year?**
Right from my first year, I wanted to contribute whatever I could, to the campus. So, I worked in a lot of departments for that reason and met a lot of people during the work. My vision for the campus is to preserve and enhance the present culture. The best thing about BPHC is that everything is managed by the students. We bring in sponsorships, we take care of the logistics, we design, we do publicity for our fests. Other colleges don't do all this work, and they don't do it as effectively as we do. It's a good thing to have a culture like this in between our busy academics and stressful studies. So, yeah, my vision for the campus is to preserve our culture.

**Have you done any significant work outside of these clubs and departments?**
I have worked for the Admissions Divisions. It was a new experience, I got to meet a lot of juniors, and interact with a lot of professors. Last week, Da collaborated with NSS on a project called the Monster Project. In that, we went to a pre school-Zila Parishad School and asked the kids to draw a monster, and we took those monsters and made professional art out of it. So far, we have released 5 artworks, and we'll do the rest in about 2 to 3 weeks. You can check them out on the Da page.

**What clubs and departments have you worked for?**
I personally feel the General Secretary must have qualities beyond just clubs and departments credentials. But to answer your question, I have worked for DePP, where I brought in Rs. 50k in cash registrations, and DoSH. I have been a part of the dramatics club since my first semester. I was the logistics and production head of Crimson Curtain this year. I also made an anti-ragging movie, after having been inducted into the Movie Club, which was submitted to the UGC. I was also in BITSMUN Publicity OC, Fervour OC, Drug Business event of Panacea, and there are numerous other things that I have been a part of.

**What kind of leadership experience have you got? Do you think it will help you go about your work if you and when you become the General Secretary?**
I have worked with students from first, third and fourth years alike and I think I know the pulse of the campus. I have come to know the needs and priorities of students from my interaction with them and will take them to the notice of GAD. My main field of work has been publicity and logistics, which are two of the things a General Secretary is expected to have experience in. I have also tried working in other realms of work too, but publicity and logistics is the reason I have chosen to contest for this post. I have made the right contacts both within and outside the campus through my work, which will be helpful in getting things done.

**Any significant work outside the general department and club works?**
I feel we haven’t showcased our talent outside the campus much until recently. Our dramatics, stand-up and dance team have done a wonderful job at IIT Hyderabad and other institutes. I personally got attached to the colours of youth talent show, to which I was leading the contingent from our campus. Despite being from a technical institute, we have put up an impressive act. I also hosted Baithak, Lohri, Guru Purab, Freshers, and Glitterati.

**What vision do you have for the campus?**
I feel the level of interaction between different batches isn’t what it used to be, which I would like to revamp. I want to dedicate an entire team for this, that interacts with students every fortnight. I envision an SUC, which acts as a bridge between GAD and the General Body and makes its voice heard to the GAD. In fact, my motto which goes “your initiative, my effort, our change”, is based around this idea.
