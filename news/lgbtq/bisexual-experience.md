<!-- TITLE:  From Sweats to Strength: The Bisexual Experience -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Today we bring to you an account from a 2004 batch graduate of the Goa Campus. The alumnus wishes to remain anonymous and identifies as bisexual. -->

I am Anonymous. Yeah, that’s how I would like to introduce myself. I am Anonymous, in my early thirties. No, I won’t even tell you the first letter of my name. The only letter I’ll offer you here is ‘B’, from LGBTQ. I’ve been living two lives ever since I realized I was attracted to both boys and girls. And no, my orientation is not an effect of the child abuse I went through at the ripe old age of seven, which lasted for five years. For some reason, many think that’s a reason to ‘turn’ gay. It’s not.

I remember surfing the internet and finding the meanings of ‘L’, ‘G’ and ‘B’. I remember seeing the bigger picture and realizing I wasn’t alone. I remember finding a dating website for men with similar interests. I remember going on my first date.

It was the second year of engineering. A very strange feeling. Heartbeat so high, ready to explode. I needn’t have worried, though. The first thing he said was, “Are you meeting a stranger for the first time?”. He’d immediately guessed the reason behind my shivering and sweating. Gently, he took me to an isolated spot in a park and shared his experiences of being bisexual, being bisexual after his marriage. He made me feel so comfortable that day, I gained courage. Courage to lead my life normally just like anybody else. Making peace with the fact that I love boys the same way I love girls. The date lasted for only two hours, but I walked away with a lot of knowledge and a polished understanding of my own feelings.

It has been 12 years since then. I don’t have any regrets being bisexual in this country. But in the environment where I come from, I am still afraid to use the ‘B’ word. That part of me is still unseen by my family and many of my friends. When I moved into a metropolis, I could finally expand my circle and hang out with the LGBTQ community. I hang out more with LGBTQ friends than straight ones. They let me live like me.

Not everyone is a friend in the city. Fraud and blackmailing crept up through the apps and frightened me deeply. But I consoled myself and learned to restrict my circle and my exploration of the world. As I became smarter dealing with people, my family back home plunged into the deep sea of wedding plans. My heart sunk with them.

But I didn’t worry too much. Bisexual, so nothing to lose, right? Still, tiny thoughts crept up. What if I still wanted to meet men after marriage? Triangle relationships? I’d never been with a man…Despite all this thinking, I never felt the need to block any friendships with the LGBTQ community after getting married. I’ve seen a few of my friends do this, and I think it’s puzzling. Can’t a person understand the limits of being married or being in a relationship? Straight men certainly don’t block all their female friends after finding a girlfriend. We aren’t any different.

The friends I have from the community are more like family. We literally attend each other’s family functions too. We share a life hidden from the outside world. Just like a family shares a life hidden from the outside world. The friends I made in this community supported me in distress. After I broke my marriage for some other reasons, they stood behind me. Our lives do not revolve completely around our sexual orientation. It is but a part of a whole.

I mull over these things in my mind. Can a better half accept our orientation even if she/he doesn’t share it? What if two bisexuals of opposite gender decide to spend their lives together in mutual understanding and love? Perhaps most importantly, when will I not need introduce myself as Anonymous, to talk about these heart-wrenchingly universal issues we all think about in some way or the other? Issues of acceptance, love, romance, respect and understanding.
