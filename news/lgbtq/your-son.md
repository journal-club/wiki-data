Note From the Writer: I was actually pretty hesitant about writing this article, because even though I’m writing this anonymously, some of you might know me and I’d be risking you figuring it out. Even if the slightest suspicion (whether it is me or you wrongly suspect someone else) leaks out it may lead to bad consequences. But I decided that the risk of being discovered is worth it, I had to represent transgenders, and a BITSian being transgender really stands out. So please read this as an awareness article and my identity really doesn’t matter. Let’s not make anyone a scapegoat.

-----

It is comfortable when I dress the way I feel, a way that represents who I am on the inside just like anyone else. Most of you have been fortunate in that the body you were born with reflects your gender. But not me. I was born with the body of a girl. No, I’m not a tomboy. No, I don’t belong to another third gender. No, I don’t want to be a boy. No, that is not why my dressing sense is masculine.

My dressing sense is masculine because I AM MALE. So what if my body doesn’t agree with me?

Now, you don’t have to tell me that a lot of people aren’t comfortable with my gender orientation. I know because I’m the target at which they throw their discomfort. They refused to be my friends in school. They isolated me. They refused to help me. They refused to teach me like they taught the others children. They bullied me. They passed comments. They were confused. They stopped me when I tried to enter the hostel, because as much as I’d like to live in the boys hostel, I’m not allowed to. Which checking line at the malls should I stand in, with my body’s gender or my mind’s? Why do the security guards grope me instead of the mild frisking that everyone goes through? Which toilet should I use, so that I don’t confuse you?

Having said that, the lack of awareness about transgenders has actually helped me be accepted as my assigned gender, despite exhibiting obvious and prominent characteristics of my preferred gender, and standing out from people of my assigned gender. I was scared that it would be extremely obvious, but fortunately, most people never even suspected anything of that sort.

It is much easier in BITS Pilani to be a transgender than in most south Indian colleges where they have a dress code for both genders. The genders are split up, and even talking to a person of the opposite gender is forbidden. It is also better than being at an IIT because of the single room and no attendance policy giving the student the time and space that they absolutely require, to discover themselves rather than forcing them to socialise with their batchmates unnecessarily. It allows them to skip all human contact, if they need to.

Being trans on campus - means that you are getting educated, and will be equipped with something to earn money, and campus definitely provides us the time to develop ourselves to make a living. This is half the fight for every transgender.

Thankfully, my parents too are in this fight with me. They know, accept and support me.

I’ve been going through a lot lately, not just because of this, but also professionally and in matters of health. My grandparents thought the way out of this was an astrologer. My parents make heaven and earth meet for me. Going to an astrologer for one measly meeting is the least I can do for them.

I told her I was a girl, didn’t want to create unnecessary drama. But she saw the way I dressed. She pried and probed and came to a conclusion that I had trouble with my gender. She said I had to start dressing like a girl, acting like a girl. She said that if I didn’t feel like a girl, she’d teach me. She wanted to convert me. She pointed out all the ways my life could go wrong. I try to be strong, but it’s hard to do so in a situation like this.

My mom, however, had my back. Upon hearing all this, she started crying. She told the astrologer not to force me, that my happiness was all that mattered. Believe it or not, the astrologer changed her tune. She said that I could get a sex change surgery and be masculine. She said it was in my fate that my physicality matches my gender. The astrologer said what she had to, to please my mom. For, my mother was the one who was paying.

The incident with the astrologer is only one of the many emotionally draining experiences I’ve had to face in my life due to my dysphoria. Thankfully, for me, my mom had my back and I have utmost faith that both my parents will be by my side in all my times of trouble. I’ve made friends and have a strong support system. But what about all the other transgender people out there who don’t have anyone watching out for them? Are they to just continue going through stressful and traumatising incidents until it breaks them? Until they lose all hope?
