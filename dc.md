# What is DC?
DC++ is in essence a software that allows you to share files over our LAN, or the internal network of the campus. Collectively, us BITSians have shared over 100 TB of data (try to assess that figure in your head), ranging from the latest movies, TV shows and PC games, to class notes, video tutorials, softwares and books. There is very little you cannot find on the network and you will be missing a lot if you remain unfamiliar with DC++.
# How It Works
DC++ works on the principle of sharing. When you're connected to the network, the files you have shared are available for others to download. Other users can search and download the files you have shared, but only when you're online. As you can see, it is essential for everyone to share their files so that everyone can benefit from it. Keeping this in mind, most of the campus hubs/networks have a minimum share limit (usually 25GB/50GB) - unless you share the minimum amount of files, you're not allowed to connect to the hub. 
# Installation
1. Download the DC++ client. You can get the latest version [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus/).
2. Install it. (Click next, accept everything, etc.)
3. Open the ‘Settings’ menu by clicking the little grey gear icon on the top, or hitting Ctrl+F3.
4. Click on the ‘Personal Information’ tab
5. Enter your nick and description. Do not take this decision lightly. Your nick will identify you to your fellow BITSians not just on DC++, but also in college and all future interactions. Trust me, you want something unique.
6. Ignore all other settings in this tab, and head over to ‘Connectivity’. Double click on the tab to open up the other options, if you don’t see ‘Manual configuration’, ‘Bandwidth limiting’, and ‘Proxy’ under it.
7. Under ‘Connectivity’, check ‘Let DC++ determine the best connectivity settings’. Hit ‘Detect now’ and wait for DC++ to do its magic. You should get a message saying that it was successful in mapping the ports. (If not, look at the Troubleshooting section).
8. Head over to the ‘Sharing’ tab and select folders to total at least 25 GB of shareable data. That means no system files or other junk, or else you will be kicked out.
9. Hit Ctrl+Q to open the quick connect dialog box.
10. Enter “172.16.71.71”. This is the **hub address** for LegendHub, our college’s “official” DC hub. You will get to know of some others in time. (Save the address under Favourite Hubs, the little star icon).
11. If all goes well, you should see the LegendHub welcome message. Don’t forget to say hi!
# What Next?
So, you’ve successfully connected to LegendHub! Well, you could search for your favourite movies or TV shows (using the small magnifying glass icon). A list of results will pop up in a new tab. Double click on the one you like to start downloading to the default directory (you can change it to prevent your drive getting filled up). Alternatively, you could also browse the ‘file list’ of some user by right clicking on their name (in the users panel on the right hand side) and selecting ‘Browse file list’. 

We also have a [Facebook Group](www.facebook.com/groups/bphcdc) for DC, named "Stronger DC for BPHC", containing news about the latest files that have been added to the network. You can also post requests and interact with fellow DC users here.
# Troubleshooting
## Common Errors
- **Red bar** - settings>Connectivity>manual configuration>untick "let dc++... " and use other options one by one, something should work. 
- **Low speeds** - right click on download and search for alternatives. Also, avoid using Campus WiFi for DC++ - use the LAN ports in your room.
- **No slots** - right click>send private message and ask for a slot, or try **searching for alternatives**
- **Downloads not stopping?** View>Download Queue (Ctrl+D) and right click>remove the downloads that you don’t want. You can set priorities to your downloads here!

## Sharing issues
- Settings>Sharing - Add folders which you want to share. 
- It is recommend to share at least 50-100GB of data for normal use, and 200 GB+ for premium use. A minimum of 25 GB has to be shared though.
- The best way is to share your DC download directory. Share from your hard drives if your system does not have enough space. Do not remove external storage before closing DC otherwise, it will have to be re hashed.
- P.S. If you do not have enough disk space to meet the minimum share requirements (or have a MacBook), you can fill [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/A2HNX5ZEZiePLdkE3) to be considered for VIP access, without sharing.
