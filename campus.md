The campus presently has eight hostel blocks (known as Bhawans) with more under construction. Till 2017, every student was provided with a separate room. From 2017 onwards, the new hostel blocks, Valmiki and Gautam Bhawan, had double rooms. Every floor of the Bhawans have a common room that either has a television and chairs or TT table and carroms boards, alternating every floor. 

## Dining Halls

The mess serves four meals a day (breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner), and functions as an All Night Canteen (ANC) after dinner hours.
