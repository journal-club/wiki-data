# Logistics
The event is organised at the BITS Hyderabad Campus and accomodation is provided for delegates either in the city or on campus. Since organising an MUN with 300+ delegates requires a lot of man-power, the event is usually conducted over a weekend, when there are no classes and students are free. Inductions for the organising committee of BITSMUN are usually conducted in the last weeks of August ot the first week of September, after an orientation about MUNning and BITSMUN.
## Funding
The three-day event is funded from the registration fees paid by the delegates (usually around Rs. 2000-2500) and sponsorship and associations with educational organisations, news media, hotels and restaurants and a host of companies in other sectors. Over the last few years, a few partners of BITSMUN include the British Council, Oyo Rooms, Cisco, Murugappa, BSNL, BYJUs, The Hindu and TV5. In some years, including the 2018 edition, BITSMUN was held alongside [ATMOS](/fests/atmos), the technical fest of our college wherein BITSMUN partnered with companies partnering in Atmos as well.
