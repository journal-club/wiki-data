# Overview
Put those reasoning and communication skills to the test as VM brings to you an extremely fun filled evening with the Group Discussion.
Speak among a group as an initiator, moderator, facilitator, showcase your team building skills as you voice your opinions and prove to be the best team player around!

# Rules 
Students can take on various roles during the discussion:

- **The initiator:** One who initiates the discussion? It is crucial to give the right direction to the group discussion. The person who starts the group discussion should be very sure of his understanding of the topic.

-  **Moderator:** Who keeps the group in track to reach a conclusion and makes sure there is little to no deviation in the discussion from the topic.

- **Facilitator:** The one who keeps the flow of the discussion on and maintains a balance in participation of speakers. Makes sure nobody refrains from speaking and nobody is too aggressive either. Can even cross question arguments.

- **Summarizer:** Every so often this student provides a brief summary of the discussion for others to amend or approve.

- **Elaborator:** This individual seeks a connection between the ongoing discussion and the previous sub discussions or the overall theme.
