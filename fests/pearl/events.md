### Ukti
"किस्सों की ख़िश्तें जोड़ते हैं हम रास्तों को रहबर कहते हैं, हर जज़्बात पन्नों सा पलटते हैं हम अपनी कहानियों जैसे ही होते हैं... "
इस संसार में मौजूद हर कुछ , भले ही हवा का झोंका ही क्यों ना हो , कई कहानियां ओढ़े रहता है। कुछ बयां नहीं हो पाती , कुछ सही पते पर नहीं पहुँचती , कुछ अनसुनी हो जाती हैं और कुछ आपके रूह को भी झूम उठने को मज़बूर कर देती हैं। अंजाम कहानी का जो भी हो , बयां होना ही उसकी नियति है ; और कागज़ से दिल तक का सफर उसका जीवन।
इस पर्ल, हिंदी-तरंग आपके आपके किये ला रहा है "उक्ति ", आपकी रचनाओं के लिए एक उम्दा मंच।

तो आइये, कुछ लिखते हैं !
