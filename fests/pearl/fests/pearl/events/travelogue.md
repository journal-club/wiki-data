<!-- TITLE: Travelogue -->


This is an offline Event. Choose a city. Now, you have been approached by this city’s tourism board for a task. The current situation is that number of travellers in the city hasn’t been great and seems to be on a steady decline. The government sees this city as a main attraction to the state and confident about the great structures and beauty of the city. Hence, it wants to generate a good revenue by improving the tourism, and it starts with good publicity for the same. You have been assigned with the task to make a poster or two to promote the city, highlighting the key features of the city and making it attractive. In short, they want your poster to be the Amitabh Bachchan of Gujarat Tourism. So do your best to reach the expectations and improve the tourism situation in the city.

## RULES AND REGULATIONS:

1. The dimensions of the poster should be either A4 or A3.

2. The entry should be your original work. Plagiarism of any kind shall not be tolerated in any way.

3. Your poster should be entirely illustrated. Try not to use any pictures as such directly in your work.

4. You are expected to show one or more features of the city. For e.g. but not limiting to, Charminar for Hyderabad, Gateway of India for Mumbai, Qutub Minar for Delhi and so on. You can add anything you want, but it should be relevant to the city and its landscape. Anything otherwise would contribute to negative points for the poster. So try to be as factually correct as possible.

5. You will be given 3 hours to complete your poster. You need not start from the scratch on the spot. You can collect any required things for your poster beforehand and be prepared with your idea and how to make it. You can also make a few illustrations if needed. But it is important that you do a good amount of work in completing the poster at the venue.

6. While submitting the poster, have a write-up for the poster too. It will act as an explanation of your poster and your idea on how it helps the cause of the city. The details of where to submit it will be given on spot.

7. Although the introduction is more relatable for an Indian city, you can choose a city from any country, preferably one you have visited. And do mention the name of the city in the poster (obviously).

8. Maintain a good color scheme which represents your idea and the city well.

9. The entries will be evaluated based on the relevance of the poster to the city, colors and elements used and your idea of publicizing the city.
