THEMES

Celebration

Celebration is all about spending time with loved ones and special occasions. Every celebration is a memory to be cherished. Challenge your capturing skills with composing a beautiful photograph that truly "captures the moment".

Food

Food is love. Food is life. The first true love of many, good food elevates your happiness to an entirely different level. Click a beautiful photograph of a mouthwatering delicacy, which makes your mouth water.

Wildlife

Nature is not a place to visit. It is home. Catch animals at their best because it is not about civility or domestication anymore. Go wild for this one! Wildlife is the place for your camera to be.

Still Life

In our busy schedule, we hardly take time out to truly appreciate things that are stationary, things that are permanent. Capture an extraordinary photograph of something ordinary and make it magical.

Smoke

Smoke perfectly lit up on a black or white background creates an illusion of something abstract. Mysterious and puzzling but at the same time, jaw-droopingly beautiful. Take your camera out and get the flawless essence of smoke in a beautiful photograph.
