Online Event. In this event, you have to design a cover for a music album/track. Here, it’s more about your creativity and not your graphic designing skills or mastery in a particular software. So, you need not be a skilled designer as such to participate in this event. Now, before you think of something extravagant cover for Thunder by Imagine Dragons, or Divide(the album) by Ed Sheeran, or Thriller(the album) by Michael Jackson, or How Long by Charlie Puth, there are restrictions in this event.

## Sequence

1. Choose a song/album by any artist/band. You can then start working on your cover.

2. You will have time till March 24, 2018 to complete the cover and submit it to us. The entries are to be mailed to designclub@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in with the .jpeg or .png file of the cover and the original file, like .psd or .ai file, and also the original images used, if any, as attachment to the mail with the subject as Album Art Cover Submission and body of the mail should have your details and Pearl ID and the name of the artist and album.

## RULES AND REGULATIONS:

1. The dimensions of the cover should be either between 1000px x 1000px and 1500px x 1500px for CD cover or 627px x 382 px for an audio cassette cover.

2. The entry should be your original work. Plagiarism of any kind shall not be tolerated in any way. If you have used a licensed/copyrighted photos or stock photos, kindly mention it in the mail and a link to it for validation. If you have used someone’s work as a reference, we encourage you to mention it in the mail too.

3. You are free to use any sort of software(s) to make the cover. There are no restrictions on the type of design on the cover. It can be a well illustrated, original artwork or just a single picture or a bunch of those, with edits and text. So, you can also use your phone to make the cover.

4. The song/album name and artist/band name should be mentioned on the cover for sure. If there’s any logo of the artist or band, you are free to use it in the cover.

5. The cover shouldn’t be a rip-off or somewhat similar to a real album cover. It shouldn’t be inspired from the cover of that song/album by the given artist/band.


The top 3 or 5 entries shall be posted on Designers Anonymous’ Facebook page and Instagram account, and shared by the Pearl accounts.

## Tip: 
Try to be as creative as possible. Parodies are welcome. Main focus is on how you use resources and how creatively can you make the cover. So, it is not just for designers but for everyone.
