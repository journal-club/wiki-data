<!-- TITLE: Time Machine -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Time Machine is an event organised by Journal Club during the fests Pearl/VM.  -->

Time Machine is a **writing event** in which you have to write a news report on a hypothetical scenario given to you as a prompt. The prompts will usually go back  in history and change a key event, which you will have to report in a news article. Journal Club sometimes uses this sort of a format for inductions into the club, also.

# Rules
The report is expected to be formal and unbiased (not written like an opinion editorial). It is an individual event which may also have word limits on the maximum size of the article. The entries are usually judged on factors like tone, coherence, relevance and language.
