It’s all the tiny fragments that help make the big picture come alive. So this time, all you’ll be given is that tiny fragment of a photo, and your job to draw up the rest of the pixels in your mind. Participants will be shown a bunch of photographs of various objects with only a part of the photo zoomed into and asked to guess what the subject of each photograph is. Contestants can take part in groups of two or less.
