Teams of four.
जाना पहचाना पुराना खेल एक नए अवतार में , जहाँ होंगे कई रोचक राउंड्स। मस्ती से भरी एक शाम जहां मौका होगा कई ईनाम जीतने का। Antakshari is one of the most fun filled events conducted in Pearl. Participants go through various rounds with varying rules. Some rounds also may be audio-visual, with players having to guess things related to the song played or clues shown (singers/actors/others) and sing another song related to the same. Also, there would be rounds involving singing a song related to the one the previous team sang. The scoring will vary with rounds.

## RULES :

(1) Participants will have to come in teams of min 3 and max 5.

(2) Use of internet is strictly not allowed.
