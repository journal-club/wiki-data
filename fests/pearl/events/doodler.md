# Header
Online Event. In this event, you have to create doodle a given word, based on given theme. You can think it of as the Google Doodles.

## Sequence:

1. Choose a word of your liking, with the theme being any one of the following:

* Seasons(Summer, Spring, Winter, etc).
* Carnival.
* European.
* Indian. You can start working on your doodle then.

2. You have to use the word as the base and make a doodle either of it or on it, keeping the theme in mind.

3. You will have time till March 24, 2018 to complete the doodle and submit it to us. The entries are to be mailed to designclub@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in with the .jpeg or .png file of the doodle and the original file, like .psd or .ai file as attachment to the mail with the subject as Doodler Submission and body of the mail should have your details and Pearl/BITS ID(if you have one) and the word and the theme you chose.

## Rules and Regulations:

1. The dimensions for the doodle should be either one of these: 1000px x 1000px, 1200px x 1200px or 1500px x 1500px.

2. The entry should be your original work. Plagiarism of any kind shall not be tolerated in any way.

3. The theme is the important part of this competition. Try to represent the theme in the doodle as clearly as possible. The probability of your entry to win will depend on the way you represent the theme. But don’t forget that the word too should be readable.

4. No restrictions of the software or means of making the doodle. But anything outside the theme or something which doesn’t represent the theme will be given a straight zero. Make sure a digital version of it, rather than a picture of what you drew, is submitted.

5. Send screenshots of at least 3 stages of your artwork during completion. This will serve as a reference for us as to how you did proceed with your doodle.

6. The top 3 or 5 entries shall be posted on Designers Anonymous’ Facebook page and Instagram account, and shared by the Pearl accounts.

## Tip: 
Keep you artwork clean and not complicate it. Justify the theme in your doodle.
