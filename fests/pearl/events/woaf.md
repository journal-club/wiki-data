<!-- TITLE: Words Of A Feather -->
If you consider words to be your armor and weaponry in a lone field of chaos, you're in for a spin as a significant chunk of your artillery is not yours to choose. With words being hurled at you at specific intervals and time of course, being your foe, curate the chaos you face into a tale of imagination left to run wild with your thoughts.

# Rules of Procedure
1. No word limit.
2. Words will be given by the organizers at fixed intervals of time.
3. These words must be used in your entry once, and only once.
