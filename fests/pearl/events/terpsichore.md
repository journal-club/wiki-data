# Introduction
Terpsichore, a group dance competition, is one of the biggest dance competitions during Pearl, in terms of prize money. For Pearl 2017 and 2018, the prize money for Terpsichore was around â‚¹75,000. In Pearl 2017, NIT Rourkela bagged the first place while RAIT Mumbai was the runner-up.

This event consists of two rounds - an online preliminary round, followed by the final round. In the first round, interested groups have to take a video recording of their group dance sequence and send it to the event organisers. On the basis of the video entries, a select number of teams are selected for the second round, which takes place at BITS Hyderabad during Pearl. 

Generally, all forms of dance except classical are accepted. There are also minimum and maximum limits on the number of people in a team - for Terpsichore 2018, the minimum number of dancers on stage at any time was 6, and the maximum number in a team was 30 (inclusive of helpers). There are also stringent minimum and maximum time limits. Performances are judged on a variety of factors such as coordination, choreography, stage utilization, and costumes.
