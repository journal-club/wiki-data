## Round 1 :

 One member of the team represents the given word in the form of a drawing while the 2nd member guesses it within the given amount of time.

 Participants must refrain the usage of alphabets , numbers or any other form of writing.

## Round 2:

 The teams that have qualified the round 1 in the least amount of time get to play in the round 2.

 One member is given an artwork and is expected to guide the other member of the team so that he/she can try replicating it on the whiteboard as accurately as possible.

 The member guiding the other member is not expected to speak out the name of the artwork or give any clues regarding it in the process

 The member drawing , must make sure that the picture must entirely consist of geometrical shapes only.

 No team by any means must try any unfair means to leak out the image given in the game.

## Round 3:

 The teams who have performed well in round 2, in terms of teamwork would be allowed to play in round 3.

 In Round 3 , one member is given a word and is expected to very artistically represent the word through a drawing but without lifting up the pen (i.e, once you start to draw,you cannot lift your pen off the board till the drawing is completed) while the other member tries to guess the word through the drawing.

 The teams would be judged on their timing and artistic skills.
