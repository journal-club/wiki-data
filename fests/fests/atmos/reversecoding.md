# Overview
Reverse engineering ranks highly among the programming dark arts, being one of the most challenging events focusing on creative problem solving skills. This year, we up the ante with tougher problems than ever.

# Rounds
The event will be an offline 3 hour race for the win, with the team scoring maximum points being victorious. You can participate either as a lone wolf or in teams of two.

# Problem Statement
You are given a remote system and a list of possible bugs that might exist in that system. Your task is to exploit the flaws and find out a hidden ‘key’ to gain points. Each key would get you a certain number of points, and at the end of three hours, the team with maximum points would win.
