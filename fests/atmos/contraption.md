<!-- TITLE: Contraption -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: How complex can you go?-->

# Problem Statement:
Create, Design and Build an unconventional sequence of steps that are basically energy conversions, such that once you provide initial energy to your setup, a chain reaction starts and the contraption continues to fulfill the final compulsory task.

## Compulsory Task:
To stir water in a tumbler for at least 5 seconds.

## Bonus Tasks:
1.Light a candle
2.Open a book/carton

# Rules and Regulations to be followed:
## Logistic rules:
1.A team should have minimum 2 and maximum 4 members.
2.Each team should prepare and SUBMIT an abstract of the design and schematic (of the setup) with all the steps and energy conversions duly and clearly mentioned along with at least 1 neat diagram.
3.NO AC/DC power will be provided to any team.
4.Use of explosive conversions is NOT allowed during the working of contraption.
## Event rules:
1.An initial time-period of 60 min. will be given to each team to setup their contraptions.
2.Only 2 trials/attempts are permitted.
3.Setup time of 30 min. will be given for the 2 nd trial. 10% of total points scored in the 2 nd trial will be deducted.
4.For any kind of alterations in contraption at any point of time during the trial, 20% of the points scored will be deducted.
5.Maximum two hand touches are allowed once the energy flow has started. For the next three touches, 10% points (for each touch) will be deducted. Further hand touch will lead to the disqualification of the team.
6.The steps performed for energy conversion by any ready-made product will not be scored.
7.The teams MUST complete the compulsory task, or else they will be disqualified.
8.On completion of Bonus Tasks (optional), the team will be rewarded extra 15% points (for each bonus task).
9.The decision taken by the organisers and judges will be final and binding.
10.The dimensions of the setup built should not exceed the following: 60cm X 60cm X 40cm.
## Scoring Criteria:
Different types of energy conversions to complete the task will be awarded different points, which shall be decided by the organisers. For repeated energy conversions, 5% points will be deducted for each kind.

### Judging Criteria:
1. Number of energy conversions
2. Number of steps in contraption
3. Types of energy conversions
4. Complexity of the overall contraption
5. Innovation and aesthetics
6 .In case of a tie, time taken to complete the tasks

### Guidelines for Abstract Submission:
1.The abstract should contain a detailed write up of each and every step in a tabular form.
2.Support your writeup with a neat labelled diagram and image of your contraption. Submit the abstract in the word document/pdf format, to the e-mail ID below, before   15 th October, 2017. Please include the name of your College/Institute and name of participants. The final contraption built, should follow more or less the same design and schematic as mentioned by you in the abstract.
