<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Algomaniac -->

***"Every problem has a solution. But there's always a best."***
# About the Event :
Do you love following a fixed protocol and rules to problem solving? 
Do you use certain steps to decipher that logic? 
Then, Algomaniac is just the place for you. The “certain steps”, i.e. algorithms are at the crux of this annual event. But if you have answered the questions asked above in the negative, do not worry! The event also aims at testing logic, common sense and implementation of the participants. No previous coding knowledge will be necessary for participating in the event.
# Rules :
* Participation is restricted to individuals and consists of two rounds.
* Time limit is generally from one hour to one and a half hours for each round.
* Once the event starts, no one else will be allowed to participate (do not forget to get your pens).
* Use of any kind of electronic gadgets is **not** permitted during the event.
* The invigilating team has the authority to disqualify any participation in case of violation of the above mentioned rules.
# Competition Rounds :
## Round 1
1. In this round, participants will get a set of twenty questions based on three difficulty settings (Easy, Medium and Hard).
2. Participants are expected to answer them in a few words or lines, depending upon the nature of problem asked. 
3. The answers are to be written in the space provided in the question paper.
4. On completion, the students shall submit the question papers back to the invigilators.
5. The marking scheme will be mentioned for each question. 
6. Top 33% of the total participants from Round 1 will qualify for Round 2.
## Round 2
1. Round two will also be a subjective round. 
2. Students will be given another subjective question paper.
3. Separate answer sheets will be provided this time around. 
4. The problems will be harder and will focus on general logical situations and puzzles.
# Sample Problem :
On a certain island there live only **knights**, who always tell the **truth**, and **knaves**, who always **lie**. One day you find 10 island natives standing in a circle. Each one states: "Both people next to me are knaves!" Of the 10 in the circle, what is the minimum possible number of knights?
