# Format
The competition is open to all.

Arena Description:
## Round I :
The arena for round one will be a simple track. The bot is supposed to navigate through the track without touching the side walls on the path. Touching the sidewalls will result in negative points. The distance between the sidewalls will be 40cm (5% error). The track of the arena will be shown to you 30 minutes before the starting of the first round.
## Round II:
The arena of round two will also be consisting of uneven surfaces, elevations (wedges), depressions and some other surprises which will be revealed during the round. The specifications of the wedges and depressions (height and angle of inclination) will be put up soon. The actual Layout of the arena will be shown 60 minutes before the commencement of the contest.

# Rules
- The bot should not damage the game field and should not leave a trail behind. It may be disqualified for adversely damaging the game field. -
- Only one Robot is allowed per team.
- No trials will be given before the beginning of the competition.
- Teams have to take a wise decision regarding wireless communication. Organizers will not be responsible for any kind of interference.
- Any robot that is unable to finish the task will be given just a single re-attempt. The robot has to re-start from the starting point during the re-attempt, failing which it will be disqualified.
- For a team opting for a reattempt, 5 minutes will be given to them for any readjustments they want to make.
- Failure to comply with any of the above rules will lead to disqualification.

# Judging Criteria:
1. Time and perfection in navigating are of importance in each round.
2. The time for completion of the track from start to finish shall be measured by a stopwatch. Time will not be paused in case of robot wavering off the track or other circumstances.
3. Each team will be having a total of 600 points in the beginning. Team Score will be calculated with the following relation: Score = 600 - (time taken (in sec.) to complete the arena) - 5 X (number of times the bot collides with the side walls).
4. For a reattempt 100 points will be deducted from the teamâ€™s total score i.e. the team who opt for reattempt will be scored out of 500 instead of 600, and then scoring will be done regardless of the previous performance.
5. Top teams will qualify for the 2nd round of the competition. The same rules are applicable for the score calculations in the 2nd round also.

**In any case of disputes, the decision of the judges will be considered final.**
