<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Nostrum Vitae -->

# About the Event :
Ever imagined why we consume the medicines that cure deadly diseases, how they interact with our body, why some of them have side effects! Well this event is aimed exactly for that. Medical science and research in pharmaceutical industry plays an indispensable part in drug discovery of lethal diseases which were assumed to be incurable few years back. In this world of mutations and infections, *'Survival of the fittest'* follows the one who becomes his own physician! Test your simple listening and observation skills and explore the depth of knowledge that is put into drug discovery and curing disease with this event.
# Competition Rounds :
## Round 1 :
This round is based on general knowledge on how well do you know medicines that are dispensed to treat common diseases like fever, body ache, cough and cold. The questions will be presented in a unique manner which would test the observation skills of the participants. You can easily crack these questions if you are good enough in brain storming investigations.
## Round 2 :
Problem statements will be given for diseases. Based on the problem statements, the participants must come to a conclusion about the disease. The hunt will be driven by mutations, infectiousness, symptoms. These problem statements will be given with the help of presentations. If required the participant will also be shown a video on the problem; but with some deduction of marks, for revealing the clue.
## Round 3 :
Now given that the participants identify the right disease(s), the ultimate goal is to find the drug for its treatment. This is where participants will need to apply their analytical  skills to find out the best form of drug dosage which should be given to the patient. Participants only need to pay attention to simple properties of chemicals and their interaction with the body which will be given during the event itself. So no prerequisites required!
# Important Instructions :
* The diseases which will be given in the rounds will be similar to what human beings suffer from in the present-day scenario but they will not be exactly one disease itself. They mostly will contain symptoms and mutations of multiple diseases combined to form one disease which will be cured with a combination of drugs. Our aim is to stimulate the decision making of a student in different scenario of pathology and decide how to act in which disease condition. 
* For Example: If a patient suffers from HIV AIDS and Hepatitis B (infection of liver), given the conditions, these diseases together can cause rapid destruction of white blood cells (immune system). Scientists study the subject and then conduct research on how to find a drug to combat both the diseases. Our aim is somewhat similar to this; we give an insight on how different pathways in our body are interlinked and infections use our own mechanism against us. 
* The event is thus informative by providing the participant a better understanding of the Human Physiology.
# Rules :
* Maximum of 3 people per team. 
* Individual participation is also allowed. 
* In each round, marks will be awarded out of 50. 
* For further help, prescription of drugs will be provided (although it wonâ€™t be necessary).
* Top 10 teams/individuals will be shortlisted for the final round. And 3 winners will be decided. 
* Usage of internet is strictly not allowed. 
* Further information will be provided on spot.
**Note - Not to worry about too much of literature, everything will be explained through presentations in the event itself. Only basic general knowledge about popular diseases and medication will suffice.**
