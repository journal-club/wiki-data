<!-- TITLE: Suit-Up -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Suit-Up is a management event conducted by E-Cell in ATMOS -->
# Format
There are multiple aspects at play here, including the temperament of the other participants, valuation of assets and marketing above market standards. All of this is in the quest to birth an industry that redefines business models to get ahead of the competition. Teams of up to four battle it out in a showcase of talent, skill and above all, nerves to emerge as the ones who can truly lead effectively and bring to the forefront their capabilities that are mercilessly tested in the real-world corporate environment. In Suit-Up we also include a real-world mimicking market which is represented by the algorithm used to calculate the company’s holdings at the end of every step that gets them closer to the end, which adds an extra dimension of realism in the game.
This competition is open to all.
