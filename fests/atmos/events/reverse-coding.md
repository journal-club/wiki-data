<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Reverse Coding -->

***It's easy to compile a code but can you uncompile it?***
# Overview :
Reverse engineering ranks highly among the programming dark arts, being one of the most challenging events focusing on creative problem solving skills. 
# Rounds :
* The event will be an offline 3 hour race for the win, with the team scoring maximum points being victorious. 
* You can participate either as a lone wolf or in teams of two.
# Problem Statement :
You are given a remote system and a list of possible bugs that might exist in that system. Your task is to exploit the flaws and find out a hidden ‘key’ to gain points. Each key would get you a certain number of points and at the end of three hours, the team with maximum points would win.
