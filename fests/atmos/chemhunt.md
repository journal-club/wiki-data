# Format
## Round 1: Unveil the story
This is to check your basic knowledge about the reactions involved in chemistry and their practical applications. There will be a quiz wherein questions will be in the form of a story and students will be guessing the process and the products formed in those reactions. In addition to this, videos will be shown portraying a reaction and students will be asked to write about the process occurring and the reason for the observations.

## Round 2: Think, Chase, Win
1) All the questions (except 1) have 3 parts each. (i) The first question's answer will give you the letter half of the code. Whatever answer you get, work further with the first letter of that word. Whatever this letter is will be denoted by X for simplicity. If you see something like X+2 written in the clue, it means perform a right shift of two letters in the alphabet. For example, if X=B and you have to get X+2, it will be D. If X=H then X-2 would mean F, a left shift. (ii) The second part will give you the numeral part of the code, which will be denoted by n for simplicity. (iii) The third question’s answer will give you an atom, radical or a functional group as the answer. Now you have a code consisting of two parts, a letter and a number. For example, A7. Look this up on the map provided to you and reach that place for your next clue. You will receive the next clue only when you tell the volunteer there the answer to the previous 3 questions (if your answer is wrong but you have reached the right grid, it won’t be taken into account and you should get the right answer for the next clue). Also, you have an atom/radical/functional group for each location. When you have finished with all the clues you will have traced a compound on the map using these. You need to come back to the room and tell us the compound you have traced on the map by running all over the campus.

# Rules
1. The Round 2 of Chem Hunt will be divided into 3 parts.
2. In the first part there will be a question given to you. The answer to that question will be a compound having a specific color. You will be given a map ,which will have a marked place with the same color. You will have to go that place to get your next clue.
3. For the second part ,once you reach at the correct place, you shall find your next question. The answer to the question will be the name of a chemical compound or element. The first and the last alphabet of your answer shall be given to you as a code which will be marked on the map. You are required to go the place that has the code marked on it. There you will find your final clue.
4. The third part of the Hunt is as follows- You will be given a question. The question will have properties and uses of a chemical compound. You need to guess the chemical compound and get a substance in which the same compound is present.
5. The questions will be provided at the entrance of the correct locations given on the map.
6. Only if your answer is correct you shall be given the next question.
7. Usage of internet is strictly prohibited.
8. All the decisions regarding the hunt will be taken by a pre-decided committee of experts and hence would remain indisputable
