<!-- TITLE: Beam It -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Dream big, but start small -->

# Rules
Each team shall comprise of a maximum of 4 members and a minimum of 3 members. The competition would be a three-day event as follows:

* Day 1: Casting the beams, columns and slabs.
* Day 2: Removing the mould and Curing.
* Day 3: Assembling the structure and Load bearing test.

# Specifications
1. The teams will have to cast: a) 6 columns of length 15cm each. The diameter of the column is 1’’. b) 7 beams of length 15cm each. The width of each beam is 1’’. c) 1 slab of cross section area 30cm x15cm. The thickness of the slab should be 1’’.
2. 1 reinforcement unit will be provided for each beam and column, and three units will be provided for the slab. No extra reinforcements are allowed.
3. The admixture provided would be fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag.

## Materials
* All the necessary materials including reinforcements and adhesives would be provided. The slab, beam and column should be cast only with the concrete and admixtures supplied.
* Please note that usage of materials other than the ones provided will lead to disqualification.
* The amount of reinforcements provided would be same for all teams.
* Organisers may provide additional materials if the requirements are justified.

# Grading criteria
The structure would be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* Ultimate Failure Load: The maximum load the structure can withstand without failure.
* Cost Efficiency: The lower the cost of the materials used, the better the grade. In case of a tie, the structure with the lower self-weight would be favoured.
* The decision of the judges would be final and binding.
