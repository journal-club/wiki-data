- **Innovation Showcase **
This showcase is for students, start-ups, companies, corporate partners, innovation labs, teams and individuals to showcase their path-breaking innovations on a common platform, and to attract other motivated, talented students to join them in their projects.

Atmos believes in enabling people and technology from diverse fields to come together on a common platform and share their knowledge and experience for the betterment of the technological atmosphere. The Innovation Showcase is a step towards making this philosophy true. Teams from different fields like medicine, space tech, artificial intelligence etc. would come together to give us a glimpse of what the future has in store for us.
- **Innovation Competition **
The competition is primarily intended towards the student community and smaller innovative start-ups. It provides a platform for the participants to showcase the projects undertaken by them in front of a diaspora of people which includes professionals from various fields, corporate representatives and students from all over the country.
