# Format
The Tech Expo comprises of two segments:-
- **Innovation Showcase**
This showcase is for students, start-ups, companies, corporate partners, innovation labs, teams and individuals to showcase their path-breaking innovations on a common platform, and to attract other motivated, talented students to join them in their projects. The participating teams will be given some carpet area to showcase their projects, and they would have a chance to show their work and to interact with the participants, prominent tech personalities, professors, Corporate Representatives and prospective investors.
Atmos believes in enabling people and technology from diverse fields to come together on a common platform and share their knowledge and experience for the betterment of the technological atmosphere. The Innovation Showcase is a step towards making this philosophy true. Teams from different fields like medicine, space tech, artificial intelligence etc. would come together to give us a glimpse of what the future has in store for us.
- **Innovation Competition**
The competition is primarily intended towards the student community and smaller innovative start-ups. It provides a platform for the participants to showcase the projects undertaken by them in front of a diaspora of people which includes professionals from various fields, corporate representatives and students from all over the country. This gives the students an opportunity to connect with students and start-ups doing similar work and create future opportunities and projects for themselves while competing for the grand prizes.
