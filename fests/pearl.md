<!-- TITLE: Pearl -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The cultural fest of BITS Pilani-Hyderabad Campus. -->

# Introduction
Pearl is the annual national cultural fest of BITS Hyderabad. Incepted in 2009 as an intra-college festival, a year after the foundation of BITS Hyderabad, the fest grew by leaps and bounds to become the huge event it is today. The fest also hosts talks and pro-shows with celebrities and bands performing during the fest. 
# History
The idea of a college fest for BITS-Pilani Hyderabad was initially conceived by its students in the first academic year of the campus, 2008-09. It was named Pearl in reference to the popularity of Hyderabad for its pearls. Initially envisioned as a cultural-cum-technical fest of the campus, the first edition of Pearl was organized in 2009 as a conglomeration of intra-college competitions. The following year, it turned into an inter-college festival with participants from 50 colleges across India attending it. Since inception, the organization of Pearl has been solely the responsibility of the students of BITS-Pilani Hyderabad. For the first four years, i.e. 2009-2012, Pearl consisted of both technical and cultural events. In 2013, however, the technical events were separated and began being organized as the technical fest of the campus, ATMOS.

Over the 9 years since its first edition, the fest grew into one of the biggest fests in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and a widely known college fest across India. National and international artists and bands including Farhan Akhtar, Grammy-winning Wolfmother, Vishalâ€“Shekhar, Xandria, and Dark Tranquility have performed during the pro-shows of the fest.
